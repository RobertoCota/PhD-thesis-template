abstract = {Direct spectroscopic evidence of the presence of organic phenolate ions at the air/aqueous interface has been established using the nonlinear spectroscopic technique of vibrational sum frequency generation (SFG). By probing the phenol C–OH and the phenolate C–O− vibrational stretches, which occur in the range of 1200–1300cm−1 and are distinguishable, we have succeeded in determining the identities of the chemical species present at the air/aqueous interface of phenol–phenolate solutions at bulk pH values ranging from 3.2 to 13.2. We have found that in addition to phenolate ions that phenol is present at the interface at high bulk pH values.},

abstract = {Presented herein is a thorough investigation of the consequences of coupling ion migration to dielectric relaxation in the solvent. A self‐consistent continuum model is developed from both local (stress tensor) and global (dissipation function) considerations. The friction coefficient of a moving ion is computed in terms of the dimensionless coupling parameter where e is the ion charge, $\eta$ is the solventviscosity, $\epsilon$0 and $\epsilon$∞ are the low and high frequency dielectric constants of the solvent, respectively, $\tau$ D is the Debye dielectric relaxation time of the pure solvent, and R is the ionic radius. For small ions the computed frictional drag is practically independent of ion radius, provided some degree of hydrodynamic slip is allowed at the ion surface. The effect of ion migration on the dielectric relaxation time of the solution is analyzed in detail. It is shown that the Debye–Falkenhagen effect should lead to an increase in the observed relaxation time, while the kinetic ion–solvent coupling introduces one or more relaxation times, all less than the Debye time of the pure solvent.},

abstract = {The present work tries to clarify the molecular origin of the poor solubility of benzene in water. The transfer of benzene from pure liquid phase into water is dissected in two processes: transfer from gas phase to pure liquid benzene; and transfer from gas phase to liquid water. The two solvation processes are analyzed in the temperature range 5-100°C according to Lee's Theory. The solvation Gibbs energy change is determined by the balance between the work of cavity creation in the solvent, and the dispersive interactions of the inserted benzene molecule with the surrounding solvent molecules. The purely structural solvent reorganization upon solute insertion proves to be a compensating process. The analysis shows that the work of cavity creation is larger in water than in benzene, whereas the attractive energetic interactions are stronger in benzene than in water; this scenario is true at any temperature. Therefore, both terms act in the same direction, contrasting the transfer of benzene from pure liquid phase into water and determining its hydrophobicity.},

We find that the reorientation of the O–D groups of HDO molecules hydrating the Cl− and I− anions occurs on two different time scales with time constants of 2±0.3ps and 9±2ps. The fast component is due to a wobbling motion of the O–D group that keeps the hydrogen bond with the halogenic anion intact. For solutions of N(alkyl)4Br salts we observe a very strong slowing down of the reorientation of water that is associated with the hydration of the hydrophobic alkyl groups of the N(alkyl)4+ ions.},

abstract = {The reaction mechanism for acetic acid dissociation in aqueous solution has been investigated by combining the metadynamics method with transition path sampling (TPS). By using collective variables that describe not only the deprotonation of the acid but also the solvation state of the hydronium ion and its distance from the acetate, a reactive trajectory in which stable separated ions were produced was obtained. More transition trajectories were sampled by using the TPS technique, taking the metadynamics trajectory as the initial trajectory. Two different dissociation reaction pathways were determined, one driven by the breaking of an H-bond formed by the water molecule in contact with the hydroxyl and involving the formation of a metastable contact ion pair and the other characterized by a direct transfer of the proton to the solution through an unstable Zundel-ion-like intermediate.

abstract = {For more than two decades, dielectric properties (i.e., permittivity) have been used for soil water content measurements, but unexpected results have been shown for saline soils or soils high in smectite clays. Permittivity is complex with real and imaginary components, and varies with frequency. The frequency dependence is due to dipole rotation and charge migration processes under alternating current Dielectric relaxation refers to the reorienting of molecules after an electrical field is removed. The objective of this study was to develop a procedure for determining complex permittivity spectra for soils. Six soils with a range of mineralogies were preequilibrated at four duplicated water contents. They were packed into truncated coaxial cells, and the reflection-scattering parameter was measured for frequencies between 300 kHz to 3 GHz, although the primary calculation procedure was valid to {\textless}100 MHz. The calculated complex permittivity was difficult to use for deriving unique parameters because of overlapping influence of electrical conductivity and multiple dielectric relaxation processes that extended beyond the measured frequency range. The complex resistivity was easier to interpret, clearly showing one major relaxation process, except for the driest soils. The relaxation frequency determined from complex resistivity increased significantly as water content and electrical conductivity increased. For each soil, the square root of apparent permittivity, $\epsilon$a1/2, significantly increased as frequency decreased and as water content increased. The $\epsilon$a1/2 showed frequency dependence ranging from 1.1-fold per order of magnitude for Cecil soil to almost 2.5-fold for Ida soil. Developing procedures to extend the measured and calculated frequency range would enhance data analysis options. {\textcopyright} Soil Science Society of America.},

The technique is based on linear least squares minimization and aims primarily at the analysis of compound experimental spectra of complex dielectric permittivity.

No prior knowledge about the number of relaxation modes, their characteristic times, relaxation strengths, or the functional form of the underlying relaxation time distribution function is required, the procedure determines these parameters instead. The method is tested by both synthetic spectra with well-defined parameters of dielectric relaxation and experimental wide-band dielectric spectra of different types. We believe that this new fitting instrument, which allows an unbiased approach to the formal description of dielectric spectra, may be of interest in many areas of dielectric spectroscopy. {\textcopyright} 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Despite their differences, these materials share unique common physical behaviors, such as liquid anomalies, open crystalline structures, and extremely poor glass-forming ability at ambient pressure. To reveal the physical origin of these anomalies and their link to the shape of the phase diagram, we systematically study the properties of the Stillinger-Weber potential as a function of the strength of the tetrahedral interaction $\lambda$. We uncover a unique transition to a reentrant spinodal line at low values of $\lambda$, accompanied with a change in the dynamical behavior, from non-Arrhenius to Arrhenius. We then show that a two-state model can provide a comprehensive understanding on how the thermodynamic and dynamic anomalies of this important class of materials depend on the strength of the tetrahedral interaction. Our work establishes a deep link between the shape of the phase diagram and the thermodynamic and dynamic properties through local structural ordering in liquids and hints at why water is so special among all substances.},

Lithium is harder than sodium but softer than lead. The chapter illustrates the atomic, general, physical, and chemical properties of alkali metals. All the alkali metals have characteristic flame colorations because of the ready excitation of the outermost electron, and this is the basis of their analytical determination by flame photometry or atomic absorption spectroscopy. One of the most remarkable features of the alkali metals is their ready solubility in liquid ammonia to give bright blue, metastable solutions with unusual properties.

abstract = {The mobility of protons in a dioxolane-linked gramicidin A channel (D1) is comparable to the mobility of protons in aqueous solutions (Cukierman, S., E. P. Quigley, and D. S. Crumrine. 1997. Biophys. J. 73:2489-2502). Aliphatic alcohols decrease the mobility of H+ in aqueous solutions. In this study, the effects of methanol on proton conduction through D1 channels were investigated in different lipid bilayers and at different HCl concentrations. Methanol attenuated H+ currents in a voltage-independent manner. Attenuation of proton currents was also independent of H+ concentrations in solution. In phospholipid bilayers, methanol decreased the single channel conductance to protons without affecting the binding affinity of protons to bilayers. In glycerylmonooleate membranes, the attenuation of single channel proton conductances qualitatively resembled the decrease of conductivities of HCl solutions by methanol. However, in both types of lipid bilayers, single channel proton conductances through D1 channels were considerably more attenuated than the conductivities of different HCl solutions. This suggests that methanol modulates single proton currents through D1 channels. It is proposed that, on average, one methanol molecule binds to a D1 channel, and attenuates H+ conductance. The Gibbs free energy of this process (DeltaG0) is approximately 1.2 kcal/mol, which is comparable to the free energy of decrease of HCl conductivity in methanol solutions (1.6 kcal/mol). Apolar substances like urea and glucose that do not transport protons in HCl solutions and do not permeate D1 channels decreased solution conductivity and single channel conductance by a considerably larger proportion than methanol. Cs+ currents through D1 channels were considerably less (fivefold) attenuated by methanol than proton currents. It is proposed that methanol partitions inside the pore of gramicidin channels and delays the transfer of protons between water and methanol molecules, causing a significant attenuation of the single channel proton conductance. Gramicidin channels offer an interesting experimental model to study proton hopping along a single chain of water molecules interrupted by a single methanol molecule.},

abstract = {Insulin homodimer associates through the coupled folding and binding of two partially disordered monomers. We aim to understand this dynamics by observing insulin dimer dissociation initiated with a nanosecond temperature jump using transient two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy (2D IR) of amide I vibrations. With the help of equilibrium FTIR and 2D IR spectra, and through a systematic study of the dependence of dissociation kinetics on temperature and insulin concentration, we are able to decompose and analyze the spectral evolution associated with different secondary structures. We find that the dissociation under all conditions is characterized by two processes whose influence on the kinetics varies with temperature: the unfolding of the $\beta$ sheet at the dimer interface observed as exponential kinetics between 250 and 1000 $\mu$s and nonexponential kinetics between 5 and 150 $\mu$s that we attribute to monomer disordering. Microscopic reversibility arguments lead us to conclude that dimer association requires significant conformational changes within the monomer in concert with the folding of the interfacial $\beta$ sheet. While our data indicates a more complex kinetics, we apply a two-state model to the $\beta$-sheet unfolding kinetics to extract thermodynamic parameters and kinetic rate constants. The association rate constant, ka (23 °C) = 8.8 × 105 M-1 s-1 (pH 0, 20{\%} EtOD), is approximately 3 orders of magnitude slower than the calculated diffusion limited association rate, which is explained by the significant destabilizing effect of ethanol on the dimer state and the highly positive charge of the monomers at this pH.},

A theoretical circuit model, which incorporates the Debye-Falkenhagen dispersion in a rigorous manner, has been developed for this type of cell and low field conditions. A maximum conductance at a specific high frequency has been observed at a certain concentration for each electrolyte due to the bulk circuit elements interaction and an expression has been derived that enables comparison of the experimental data with numerical solutions. The calculations, based on the classical interpretation of ionic conductance, are in satisfactory agreement with experimental results for the lower concentrations only.

abstract = {Broadband dielectric spectra of a variety of aqueous solutions are evaluated as to indications of water that may be considered bound. Static permittivity decrements due to depolarizing internal electric fields, from kinetic depolarization, as well as from dielectric saturation are discussed. The latter effect reflects the preferential orientation of water permanent dipole orientations within strong Coulombic field of small ions, especially multivalent cations. Such water may be considered bound even though rapid rotations around the orientation of the electric dipole moment are definitely possible and also a fast exchange of water molecules between the hydration region and the bulk may take place. Water exhibiting large dielectric relaxation times, as typical for regions with large local concentration of foreign matter, may also be named bound. However, no clear evidence for interaction energies exceeding the hydrogen bond energy of pure water has been found. Rather enhanced relaxation times at low water content reflect the small concentration of hydrogen bonding sites and thus low probability density for the formation of a new hydrogen bond.

We calculate the temperature dependence for proton mobility and the total effective bond orders in the first two solvation shells surrounding the H 5 O 2 + proton-transferring complex. We find that proton-hopping between adjacent water molecules proceeds via this intermediate, but couples to hydrogen-bond dynamics in larger water clusters than previously anticipated. A two-color classification of these hydrogen bonds leads to an extended mechanism for proton mobility.},

abstract = {The structural properties of the influenza A virus M2 transmembrane channel in dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine bilayer for each of the four protonation states of the proton-gating His-37 tetrad and their effects on proton transport for this low-pH activated, highly proton-selective channel are studied by classical molecular dynamics with the multistate empirical valence-bond (MS-EVB) methodology. The excess proton permeation free energy profile and maximum ion conductance calculated from the MS-EVB simulation data combined with the Poisson-Nernst-Planck theory indicates that the triply protonated His-37 state is the most likely open state via a significant side-chain conformational change of the His-37 tetrad. This proposed open state of M2 has a calculated proton permeation free energy barrier of 7 kcal/mol and a maximum conductance of 53 pS compared to the experimental value of 6 pS. By contrast, the maximum conductance for Na(+) is calculated to be four orders of magnitude lower, in reasonable agreement with the experimentally observed proton selectivity. The pH value to activate the channel opening is estimated to be 5.5 from dielectric continuum theory, which is also consistent with experimental results. This study further reveals that the Ala-29 residue region is the primary binding site for the antiflu drug amantadine (AMT), probably because that domain is relatively spacious and hydrophobic. The presence of AMT is calculated to reduce the proton conductance by 99.8{\%} due to a significant dehydration penalty of the excess proton in the vicinity of the channel-bound AMT.},

abstract = {The neuroprotective agent 3-hydroxymorphinan (3-HM) is a well-documented and highly safe therapeutic intervention for the inflammatory-related effects of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the bioavailability of 3-HM is very low due to the rapid first-pass metabolism of the phenolic moiety. In the present study, we sought to improve the metabolic stability and overall pharmacokinetic profile of 3-HM. Based on an iterative design process that a suitably arranged heterocycle with an NH group would serve as the metabolically stable isostere of the phenolic group, we designed and synthesized two analogues of 3-HM. Benzimidazolone compound 8 (imidazolone-morphinan) was comparable in activity to 3-HM against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory responses in microglial BV2 cells and in vivo animal experiments (MPTP-induced PD mouse model). Moreover, the in vitro study showed that imidazolone-morphinan was non-toxic to microglia, indicating its high safety. Considering the favourable and unique preclinical profiles, compound 8 was nominated as a candidate for further clinical development.},

abstract = {The level of complexity with which any biological ion interaction mechanism can be investigated, whether it is a binding mechanism in proteins or a permeation mechanism in ion channels, is invariably limited by the state-of-the-art of our understanding of the characteristic properties of ion solvation. Currently, our understanding of the energetic properties of ion solvation in aqueous phase is considered adequate enough to have helped us obtain satisfactory descriptions of the role of energetics in several biological ion interaction processes. In contrast, the lack of consensus among all the experimental structural hydration data determined more than 10 years ago, particularly regarding ion hydration numbers, has limited us to nothing better than speculation regarding the roles of local spatial environments in these mechanisms. Here we revisit experimental and theoretical work applied to probe hydration numbers of three alkali metal ions, Li+, Na+ and K+, and analyze them to clarify the current state-of-the-art of our understanding of their structural hydration properties. We find that with substantial improvements over the past 10 years in areas of experimental techniques, data analysis strategies, and theoretical and computational approaches for interrogating ion hydration structures, there is now growing consensus regarding the hydration numbers of these ions. We see that under physiological conditions, ab initio methods suggest that all three ions prefer strong coordination with exactly 4 water molecules, a result we find consistent with some older experimental measurements. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations invariably identify additional “loosely” coordinated water molecules at the far slopes of the principle maxima of the radial distribution profiles for Na+ and K+ ions. We suggest that these statistical admixtures of additional oxygen atoms have resulted in the most recent experimentally determined hydration numbers of Na+ ions to be 5 and K+ ions to be 6.},

abstract = {Dielectric relaxation of aqueous solutions of micelles, proteins, and many complex systems shows an anomalous dispersion at frequencies intermediate between those corresponding to the rotational motion of bulk water and that of the organized assembly or macromolecule. The precise origin of this anomalous dispersion is not well-understood. In this work we employ large scale atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the dielectric relaxation (DR) of water molecules in an aqueous micellar solution of cesium pentadecafluorooctanoate. The simulations clearly show the presence of a slow component in the moment-moment time correlation function [PhiMW(t)] of water molecules, with a time constant of about 40 ps, in contrast to only 9 ps for bulk water. Interestingly, the orientational time correlation function [Cmu(t)] of individual water molecules at the surface exhibits a component with a time constant of about 19 ps. We show that these two time constants can be related by the well-known micro-macrorelations of statistical mechanics. In addition, the reorientation of surface water molecules exhibits a very slow component that decays with a time constant of about 500 ps. An analysis of hydrogen bond lifetime and of the rotational relaxation in the coordinate frame fixed on the micellar body seems to suggest that the 500 ps component owes its origin to the existence of an extended hydrogen bond network of water molecules at the surface. However, this ultraslow component is not found in the total moment-moment time correlation function of water molecules in the solution. The slow DR of hydration water is found to be well correlated with the slow solvation dynamics of cesium ions at the water-micelle interface.},

abstract = {We present an investigation into hydrogen bonding dynamics and kinetics in water using femtosecond infrared spectroscopy of the OH stretching vibration of HOD in D 2O. Infrared vibrational echo peak shift and polarization-selective pump-probe experiments were performed with mid-IR pulses short enough to capture all relevant dynamical processes. The experiments are self-consistently analyzed with a nonlinear response function expressed in terms of three dynamical parameters for the OH stretching vibration: the frequency correlation function, the lifetime, and the second Legendre polynomial dipole reorientation correlation function. It also accounts for vibrational-relaxation- induced excitation of intermolecular motion that appears as heating. The long time, picosecond behavior is consistent with previous work, but new dynamics are revealed on the sub-200 fs time scale. The frequency correlation function is characterized by a 50 fs decay and 180 fs beat associated with underdamped intermolecular vibrations of hydrogen bonding partners prior to 1.4 ps exponential relaxation. The reorientational correlation function observes a 50 fs librational decay prior to 3 ps diffusive reorientation. Both of these correlation functions compare favorably with the predictions from classical molecular dynamics simulations. The time-dependent behavior can be separated into short and long time scales by the 340 fs correlation time for OH frequency shifts. The fast time scales arise from dynamics that are mainly local: fluctuations in hydrogen bond distances and angles within relatively fixed intermolecular configurations. On time scales longer than the correlation time, dephasing and reorientations reflect collective reorganization of the liquid structure. Since the OH transition frequency and dipole are only weakly sensitive to these collective coordinates, this is a kinetic regime which gives an effective rate for exchange of intermolecular structures.{\textcopyright} 2005 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The complex dielectric permittivity of aqueous sodium chloride solutions has been determined in the frequency range 0.2 ≤ $\nu$(GHz) ≤ 20 with a commercial dielectric measurement system based on a vector network analyzer. NaCl solutions 0.1 ≤ m (mol kg-1) ≤ 5 (mass fraction 0.005 ≤ w ≤ 0.23) were investigated at 5, 20, 25, and 35 °C. An improved calibration procedure of the dielectric measurement system for conducting samples was developed. The complex permittivity spectra have been represented by a Cole−Cole relaxation time distribution. Where possible, the obtained fitting parameters, static permittivity $\epsilon$ and relaxation time $\tau$, and distribution parameter $\alpha$, are compared with literature data to assess the performance of the instrument, which was found to be comparable to that of time domain and waveguide systems. Effective solvation numbers were deduced from the effect of NaCl concentration on $\epsilon$. The data suggest that in addition to the irrotational bonding of water molecules by Na+ ions, kinetic depolarization under slip boundary conditions determines the solution permittivity. A three-state model is proposed to describe the concentration dependence of $\tau$.},

abstract = {The theory of fluorescent emission anisotropy [r(t)] of a cylindrical probe in a membrane suspension is developed. It is shown, independent of any model, that the limiting anisotropy [r(infinity)] is proportional to the square to the order parameter of the probe. The order parameter determines the first nontrivial term in the expansion of the equilibrium orientational distribution function of the probe in a series of Legendre polynomials. Following Kinosita, Kawato, and Ikegami, the motion of the probe is described as diffusion ("wobbling") within a cone of semiangle theta 0. Within the framework of this model, an accurate single-exponential approximation for r(t) is considered. An analytic expression relating the effective relaxation time, which appears in the above approximation, to theta 0 and the diffusion coefficient for wobbling is derived. The model is generalized to the situation where the probe is attached to a macromolecule whose motion cannot be neglected on the time scale of the fluorescence experiment. Finally, by exploiting the formal similarity between the theory of fluorescence depolarization and 13C-NMR dipolar relaxation, expressions for T1, T2, and the nuclear Overhauser enhancement are derived for a protonated carbon which is nonrigidly attached to a macromolecule and undergoes librational motion described as diffusion on a spherical "cap" of semiangle theta 0. {\textcopyright} 1980, The Biophysical Society.

abstract = {We present terahertz (THz) measurements of salt solutions that shed new light on the controversy over whether salts act as kosmotropes (structure makers) or chaotropes (structure breakers), which enhance or reduce the solvent order, respectively. We have carried out precise measurements of the concentration-dependent THz absorption coefficient of 15 solvated alkali halide salts around 85 cm(-1) (2.5 THz). In addition, we recorded overview spectra between 30 and 300 cm(-1) using a THz Fourier transform spectrometer for six alkali halides. For all solutions we found a linear increase of THz absorption compared to pure water (THz excess) with increasing solute concentration. These results suggest that the ions may be treated as simple defects in an H-bond network. They therefore cannot be characterized as either kosmotropes or chaotropes. Below 200 cm(-1), the observed THz excess of all salts can be described by a linear superposition of the water absorption and an additional absorption that is attributed to a rattling motion of the ions within the water network. By providing a comprehensive set of data for different salt solutions, we find that the solutions can all be very well described by a model that includes damped harmonic oscillations of the anions and cations within the water network. We find this model predicts the main features of THz spectra for a variety of salt solutions. The assumption of the existence of these ion rattling motions on sub-picosecond time scales is supported by THz Fourier transform spectroscopy of six alkali halides. Above 200 cm(-1) the excess is interpreted in terms of a change in the wing of the water network librational mode. Accompanying molecular dynamics simulations using the TIP3P water model support our conclusion and show that the fast sub-picosecond motions of the ions and their surroundings are almost decoupled. These findings provide a complete description of the solute-induced changes in the THz solvation dynamics for the investigated salts. Our results show that THz spectroscopy is a powerful experimental tool to establish a new view on the contributions of anions and cations to the structuring of water.},

abstract = {Many of the unusual properties of liquid water are attributed to its unique structure, comprised of a random and fluctuating three-dimensional network of hydrogen bonds that link the highly polar water molecules1,2. One of the most direct probes of the dynamics of this network is the infrared spectrum of the OH stretching vibration3-11, which reflects the distribution of hydrogen-bonded structures and the intermolecular forces controlling the structural dynamics of the liquid. Indeed, water dynamics has been studied in detail5-14, most recently using multi-dimensional nonlinear infrared spectroscopy15,16 for acquiring structural and dynamical information on femtosecond timescales. But owing to technical difficulties, only OH stretching vibrations in D2O or OD vibrations in H2O could be monitored. Here we show that using a specially designed, ultrathin sample cell allows us to observe OH stretching vibrations in H2O. Under these fully resonant conditions, we observe hydrogen bond network dynamics more than one order of magnitude faster than seen in earlier studies that include an extremely fast sweep in the OH frequencies on a 50-fs timescale and an equally fast disappearance of the initial inhomogeneous distribution of sites. Our results highlight the efficiency of energy redistribution within the hydrogen-bonded network, and that liquid water essentially loses the memory of persistent correlations in its structure within 50 fs.},

abstract = {Proton transfer via hydronium and hydroxide ions in water is ubiquitous. It underlies acid–base chemistry, certain enzyme reactions, and even infection by the flu. Despite two centuries of investigation, the mechanism underlying why hydroxide diffuses slower than hydronium in water is still not well understood. Herein, we employ state-of-the-art density-functional-theory-based molecular dynamics—with corrections for non-local van der Waals interactions, and self-interaction in the electronic ground state—to model water and hydrated water ions. At this level of theory, we show that structural diffusion of hydronium preserves the previously recognized concerted behaviour. However, by contrast, proton transfer via hydroxide is less temporally correlated, due to a stabilized hypercoordination solvation structure that discourages proton transfer. Specifically, the latter exhibits non-planar geometry, which agrees with neutron-scattering results. Asymmetry in the temporal correlation of proton transfer leads to hydroxide diffusing slower than hydronium.},

These difficulties can be overcome be considering$\backslash$nadditional hydration of the H3O+ ion. Measurement an analysis of$\backslash$nthe apparent mole heat [trans?] of HCl between 0 to 130 degrees C$\backslash$nin parallel with the temperature dependance of the apparent mole$\backslash$nvolume, lead to a model of the hydration shell of H3O+. In this model,$\backslash$nH3O+ binds three water molecules in a pyramidal H9O4+ complex (`inner'$\backslash$nhydration shell) which is surrounded by an `outer' hydration shell$\backslash$nof additional loosely-bound H2O molecules by H-bonds.

abstract = {We study the effects of ions and hydrophobic molecular groups on the orientational dynamics of water using THz dielectric relaxation (THz-DR) and polarization-resolved femtosecond infrared (fs-IR) pump–probe spectroscopy. We measure the dynamics of water in solutions of NaI{\{},{\}} NaCl{\{},{\}} CsCl{\{},{\}} guanidinium chloride (GndCl) and tetramethyl guanidinium chloride (TMGndCl) of different concentrations. With THz-DR we observe that strongly hydrated cations align the static dipoles of their surrounding water molecules. With fs-IR we find that the OD groups that form hydrogen bonds to halide anions reorient with two distinct time constants of 2 ± 0.3 ps and 9 ± 1 ps. The fast process is assigned to a wobbling motion of the OD group that keeps the hydrogen bond with the anion intact. The amplitude of this wobbling motion depends on the nature of both the anion and the counter cation. The replacement of four of the six hydrogen atoms of the weakly hydrated cation guanidinium by hydrophobic methyl groups leads to an exceptionally strong slowing down of the water dynamics. Hydrophobic groups thus appear to have a much stronger effect on the dynamics of water than ions. These findings give new insights in the mechanism of protein denaturation by GndCl and TMGndCl.},

abstract = {Broadband dielectric measurements utilizing state-of-the-art coaxial reflectometry and traveling-wave interferometry have been made on aqueous solutions of the 3:2 electrolyte aluminum sulfate at 25 °C over the frequency range 0.2 ≤ $\nu$ (GHz) ≤ 89 and at total solute concentrations 0.012 ≤ c (M) ≤ 0.65. Detailed analysis of the solute contribution to the dielectric spectra revealed the simultaneous presence of double solvent-separated (2SIP), solvent-shared (SIP) and contact (CIP) ion pairs. Concentrations of the various ion-pair types and the equilibrium constants for their formation were determined using calculated dipole moments and other relevant quantities. The 2SIPs and SIPs were found to persist down to low concentrations in this notionally strong electrolyte. Good agreement was found with earlier Raman and NMR studies for CIP concentrations and with thermodynamic determinations of the overall ion association constant. In contrast to divalent metal sulfate solutions, both SIPs and, to a lesser extent, 2SIPs remain present at quite high Al2(SO4)3(aq) concentrations. The persistence of SIPs and 2SIPs was consistent with the effective hydration numbers obtained from an analysis of the cooperative H-bond relaxation mode of bulk water in the solutions. This analysis indicated that the hydration of Al3+ ions is extremely strong, with significant effects on the dielectric relaxation timescale even beyond the second hydration shell, at least in dilute solutions. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A suggested mechanism for hydroxide mobility in water identifies the rate limiting step as a cleavage of a second shell hydrogen bond which converts a H7O4− ion (triply coordinated hydroxide) to (HOHOH)− (deprotonated water dimer). Proton transfer is enabled by an additional O–O bond contraction, not required in H5O2+. This explains why the activation energy for hydroxide mobility is larger than that of proton mobility by about 0.5 kcal/mol. The transfer cycle is terminated by hydrogen-bond formation to the other oxygen center. Available experimental data, and most of the computational results, can be rationalized in the framework of the above model.},

abstract = {In the last decade, ab initio simulations and especially Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics have significantly contributed to the improvement of our understanding of both the physical and chemical properties of water, ice, and hydrogen-bonded systems in general. At the heart of this family of in silico techniques lies the crucial idea of computing the many-body interactions by solving the electronic structure problem "on the fly" as the simulation proceeds, which circumvents the need for pre-parameterized potential models. In particular, the field of proton transfer in hydrogen-bonded networks greatly benefits from these technical advances. Here, several systems of seemingly quite different nature and of increasing complexity, such as Grotthuss diffusion in water, excited-state proton-transfer in solution, phase transitions in ice, and protonated water networks in the membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin, are discussed in the realms of a unifying viewpoint.},

Consistent with spectroscopic studies, no contact ion pairs were detected over the studied concentration range. The overall ion association constants K(o)(A) obtained were in good agreement with literature data for both salts.

In the case of sugars, this solute reorientational relaxation can be isolated by EDLS measurements, whereas its contribution to the dielectric spectra is almost negligible. In the presented analysis, we characterize the hydration water in terms of hydration number and retardation ratio $\xi$ between relaxation times of hydration and bulk water. Both techniques provide similar estimates of $\xi$. The retardation imposed on the hydration water by sugars is ∼3.3 ± 1.3 and involves only water molecules hydrogen-bonded (HB) to solutes (∼3 water molecules per sugar OH-group).

abstract = {The scientific interest in room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) became extraordinarily high over the last two decades. While in the earlier days most of the studies focused on the synthesis and chemical properties, recently the interest in there physical, dynamical and structural properties is increasing. This thesis is aiming at the dynamical properties using dielectric relaxation spectroscopy. The first part of the thesis presents the development of new experimental routes and mathematical routines to record the dielectric spectra of liquids at microwave to far-infrared frequencies. It is followed by the discussion of the dielectric spectra of the neat, mainly imidazolium-based RTILs. Beside the extraction of the static dielectric constants, detailed information on the dynamics is obtained, including activation parameters. At room-temperature, the spectra are extended to terahertz and far-infrared frequencies, to cover the whole frequencies range relevant for intermolecular dynamics. Additional insight is gained by comparing these broadband spectra to molecular-dynamics simulations as well as to optical Kerr effect spectra. Finally, binary mixtures of RTILs with polar solvents are investigated. The studies on mixtures with dichloromethane are indicating an expanded RTIL-like range, where the dielectric characteristics remain similar to the neat RTIL. Only at high dilutions, the mixtures behave rather like a conventional electrolyte solution with pronounced formation of contact ion-pairs. On the other hand the mixtures with water indicate a more complex, heterogeneous structure.},

The ultrafast dynamics of the proton's hydration structure has made it extremely challenging to study experimentally. Using ultrafast broadband two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy, we show that the vibrational spectrum of the aqueous proton is fully consistent with a protonated water complex broadly defined as a Zundel-like H5O2+ motif. Analysis of the inhomogeneously broadened proton stretch two-dimensional lineshape indicates an intrinsically asymmetric, low-barrier O–H+–O potential that exhibits surprisingly persistent distributions in both its asymmetry and O–O distance. This structural characterization has direct implications for the extent of delocalization exhibited by a proton's excess charge and for the possible mechanisms of proton transport in water.},

abstract = {Many biological, chemical and physical processes involve the transfer of energy. In the case of electronic excitations, transfer between molecules is rapid, whereas for vibrations in the condensed phase, resonant energy transfer is an unlikely process because the typical timescale of vibrational relaxation (a few picoseconds) is much shorter than that of resonant intermolecular vibrational energy transfer. For the OH-stretch vibration in liquid water, which is of particular importance due to its coupling to the hydrogen bond, extensive investigations have shown that vibrational relaxation takes place with a time constant of 740 ± 25 femtoseconds (ref. 7). So for resonant intermolecular energy transfer to occur in liquid water, the interaction between the OH-stretch modes of different water molecules needs to be extremely strong. Here we report time-resolved pump-probe laser spectroscopy measurements that reveal the occurrence of fast resonant intermolecular transfer of OH-stretch excitations over many water molecules before the excitation energy is dissipated. We find that the transfer process is mediated by dipole-dipole interactions (the Forster transfer mechanism) and additional mechanisms that are possibly based on intermolecular anharmonic interactions involving hydrogen bonds. Our findings suggest that liquid water may play an important role in transporting vibrational energy between OH groups located on either different biomolecules or along extended biological structures. OH groups in a hydrophobic environment should accordingly be able to remain in a vibrationally excited state longer than OH groups in a hydrophilic environment.},

abstract = {The permittivity and loss of solutions of tri(n-butyl)ammonium picrate and iodide in various polar solvents have been measured at a number of frequencies between 0.2 and 3.0 GHz. The relative static permittivities of the pure solvents used range from 3.37 to 20.7 at 25°C. For all the solutions investigated, the observed dispersion of permittivity is adequately described by a single relaxation time, which for a given solvent depends on the concentration as well as the nature of the solute. Apparent dipole moments evaluated from the dispersion amplitude by means of B{\"{o}}ttcher's theory, on the assumption that the dipole occupies a spherical cavity, are 12.3±0.4 D and 11.2±0.6 D for the picrate and iodide respectively.

@article{Tuckerman2002,
abstract = {Compared to other ions, protons (H(+)) and hydroxide ions (OH(-)) exhibit anomalously high mobilities in aqueous solutions. On a qualitative level, this behaviour has long been explained by 'structural diffusion' the continuous interconversion between hydration complexes driven by fluctuations in the solvation shell of the hydrated ions. Detailed investigations have led to a clear understanding of the proton transport mechanism at the molecular level. In contrast, hydroxide ion mobility in basic solutions has received far less attention, even though bases and base catalysis play important roles in many organic and biochemical reactions and in the chemical industry. The reason for this may be attributed to the century-old notion that a hydrated OH(-) can be regarded as a water molecule missing a proton, and that the transport mechanism of such a 'proton hole' can be inferred from that of an excess proton by simply reversing hydrogen bond polarities. However, recent studies have identified OH(-) hydration complexes that bear little structural similarity to proton hydration complexes. Here we report the solution structures and transport mechanisms of hydrated hydroxide, which we obtained from first-principles computer simulations that explicitly treat quantum and thermal fluctuations of all nuclei. We find that the transport mechanism, which differs significantly from the proton hole picture, involves an interplay between the previously identified hydration complexes and is strongly influenced by nuclear quantum effects.},

abstract = {We detail and considerably extend the analysis recently presented in Science 2006, 311, 832-835 of the molecular mechanism of water reorientation based on molecular dynamics simulations and the analytic framework of the extended jump model (EJM). The water reorientation is shown to occur through largeamplitude angular jumps due to the exchange of hydrogen (H)-bond acceptors, with a minor contribution from the diffusive H-bond frame reorientation between these exchanges. The robust character of this mechanism with respect to different water models is discussed. We fully characterize these jump events, including the distributions of trajectories around the average path. The average path values and the distributions of the jump time and the jump amplitude, the two key parameters in the Ivanov jump model component of the EJM, are determined. We also discuss the possibility of selectively exciting water molecules close to the jump event, of interest for ultrafast infrared experiments. In addition to a comparison of predicted reorientation times with experimental results, the reorientation time temperature dependence is discussed. A detailed description of the pathway free energetics for the water reorientation is presented; this is used to identify the jump rate-limiting step as the translational motion in which the initial H-bond of the reorientating water is elongated and the new H-bond acceptor water approaches. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Chemical Society.},

@article{Roberts2009,
abstract = {It is generally accepted that the anomalous diffusion of the aqueous hydroxide ion results from its ability to accept a proton from a neighboring water molecule; yet, many questions exist concerning the mechanism for this process. What is the solvation structure of the hydroxide ion? In what way do water hydrogen bond dynamics influence the transfer of a proton to the ion? We present the results of femtosecond pump-probe and 2D infrared experiments that probe the O-H stretching vibration of a solution of dilute HOD dissolved in NaOD/D2O. Upon the addition of NaOD, measured pump-probe transients and 2D IR spectra show a new feature that decays with a 110-fs time scale. The calculation of 2D IR spectra from an empirical valence bond molecular dynamics simulation of a single NaOH molecule in a bath of H2O indicates that this fast feature is due to an overtone transition of Zundel-like H3O2- states, wherein a proton is significantly shared between a water molecule and the hydroxide ion. Given the frequency of vibration of shared protons, the observations indicate the shared proton state persists for 2{\{}$\backslash$textendash{\}}3 vibrational periods before the proton localizes on a hydroxide. Calculations based on the EVB-MD model argue that the collective electric field in the proton transfer direction is the appropriate coordinate to describe the creation and relaxation of these Zundel-like transition states.},

abstract = {We report on a strong nonadditive effect of protons and other cations on the structural dynamics of liquid water, which is revealed using dielectric relaxation spectroscopy in the frequency range of 1-50 GHz. For pure acid solutions, protons are known to have a strong structuring effect on water, leading to a pronounced decrease of the dielectric response. We observe that this structuring is reduced when protons are cosolvated with salts. This reduction is exclusively observed for combinations of protons with other ions; for all studied solutions of cosolvated salts, the effect on the structural dynamics of water is observed to be purely additive, even up to high concentrations. We derive an empirical model that quantitatively describes the nonadditive effect of cosolvated protons and cations. We argue that the effect can be explained from the special character of the proton in water and that Coulomb fields exerted by other cations, in particular doubly charged cations like Mg2+aq and Ca2+aq, induce a localization of the H+aq hydration structures.},

In this work we describe experiments focusing on a different technique for precise determination of the local temperature achieved by the cooling within the gas cell. We investigate the Kennard-Stepanov relation, a thermodynamic, Boltzmann-type scaling between the absorption and emission spectral profiles of an absorber, which applies in many liquid state dye solutions as well as in semiconductor systems. To this end, absorption and emission spectra of rubidium atoms and dimers in dense argon buffer gas environment have been recorded. We demonstrate experimentally that the Kennard-Stepanov relation between absorption and emission spectra is well fulfilled for the collisionally broadened atomic and molecular transitions of the system, which allows for the extraction of the thermodynamic temperature.},

abstract = {Proton transfer via hydronium and hydroxide ions in water is ubiquitous. It underlies acid–base chemistry, certain enzyme reactions, and even infection by the flu. Despite two centuries of investigation, the mechanism underlying why hydroxide diffuses slower than hydronium in water is still not well understood. Herein, we employ state-of-the-art density-functional-theory-based molecular dynamics—with corrections for non-local van der Waals interactions, and self-interaction in the electronic ground state—to model water and hydrated water ions. At this level of theory, we show that structural diffusion of hydronium preserves the previously recognized concerted behaviour. However, by contrast, proton transfer via hydroxide is less temporally correlated, due to a stabilized hypercoordination solvation structure that discourages proton transfer. Specifically, the latter exhibits non-planar geometry, which agrees with neutron-scattering results. Asymmetry in the temporal correlation of proton transfer leads to hydroxide diffusing slower than hydronium.},

The anharmonic coupling between the bending and the stretching degrees of freedom is quantified in terms of a differential absorption cross-section for the fundamental stretching transition carrying one spectating bending quantum. A positive off-diagonal anharmonicity may be caused by the initial excitation of the anharmonic bending mode and is mediated by the hydrogen bonded network.},

The dominating loss peak at ∼ 70 GHz, fitted by a modified Debye equation accounting for inertial rise, represents the rotational diffusion of molecular dipoles. Additionally, two libration modes contribute, which are described by damped harmonic oscillators of resonance frequencies ∼ 0.9 THz and ∼ 2.1 THz.

We have similarly analyzed the sum-frequency spectrum for the liquid/vapor interface by considering the relevant spectral density and its partitions.

Due to the preferential orientation of water molecules in the Coulombic field of small ions and also in clathrate-like structures around large ions for solutions of such solutes the hydration model seems to be justified. With solutions of predominantly hydrophobic molecules the idea of a hydration model appears to be also appropriate. Mainly hydrophilic molecules are obviously incorporated in a hydrogen-bonded network which, on many conditions, does not even allow the contributions of the solute and solvent molecules to the dielectric spectrum to be separated from another. With such mixtures it is the more inadequate to discriminate between differently affected water regions.},

abstract = {The prediction and experimental confirmation of a previously unsuspected kinetic effect occurring in electrolyte solutions are presented herein. Kinetic polarization deficiency may be described as a reduction, with respect to the pure solvent, in the static permittivity of the solution; the decrement in epsilon0 is shown to be proportional to the product of the dielectric relaxation time of the solvent and the low frequency conductivity of the solution. The kinetic ion-solvent interaction affects the capacitive admittance in two closely related ways: as an ion migrates, the surrounding volume elements of the liquid tend to rotate according to the laws of hydrodynamics, and although dielectric relaxation tends to restore an equilibrium polarization appropriate to the local electric field, this adjustment is not instantaneous; rather it lags behind by the dielectric relaxation time. Conversely, the force that an external field exerts on an ion does not develop its full strength instantly because the ion is driven partly by the external field and partly by the polarization that develops in response to the applied field, the polarization field evolving with a time constant that is the relaxation time for the orientation of solvent dipoles.},

(1) (1) In this equation, $\epsilon$* is the complex dielectric constant, $\epsilon$0 and $\epsilon$∞ are the "static" and "infinite frequency" dielectric constants, $\omega$=2$\pi$ times the frequency, and $\pi$0 is a generalized relaxation time. The parameter a can assume values between 0 and 1, the former value giving the result of Debye for polar dielectrics. The expression (1) requires that the locus of the dielectric constant in the complex plane be a circular arc with end points on the axis of reals and center below this axis. If a distribution of relaxation times is assumed to account for Eq. (1), it is possible to calculate the necessary distribution function by the method of Fuoss and Kirkwood. It is, however, difficult to understand the physical significance of this formal result. If a dielectric satisfying Eq. (1) is represented by a three-element electrical circuit, the mechanism responsible for the dispersion is equivalent to a complex impedance with a phase angle which is independent of the frequency. On this basis, the mechanism of interaction has the striking property that energy is conserved or "stored" in addition to being dissipated and that the ratio of the average energy stored to the energy dissipated per cycle is independent of the frequency.},

Herein, we show that advanced molecular dynamics (MD) methods have reached the level at which the pKa values of large solvated dye molecules can be predicted with high accuracy. Two MD methods were used in this work: steered or restrained MD and the insertion/deletion scheme. Both were first calibrated on a set of phenol derivatives and afterwards applied to the dye molecule bromothymol blue. Excellent agreement with experimental values was obtained, which opens perspectives for using these methods for designing dye molecules.},

The first one is located at about 19 GHz and is due to the reorientation of water molecules. The second one is located at approximately 100 MHz and is interpreted as being caused by DNA counterion fluctuations.

abstract = {Explanations for the anomalously high mobility of protons in liquid water began with Grotthuss's idea, of 'structural diffusion' nearly two centuries ago. Subsequent explanations have refined this concept by invoking thermal hopping, , proton tunnelling, or solvation effects. More recently, two main structural models have emerged for the hydrated proton. Eigen, proposed the formation of an H9O4+ complex in which an H3O+ core is strongly hydrogen-bonded to three H2O molecules. Zundel, , meanwhile, supported the notion of an H5O2+ complex in which the proton isshared between two H2O molecules. Here we use ab initio path integral simulations to address this question. These simulations include time-independent equilibrium thermal and quantum fluctuations of all nuclei, and determine interatomic interactions from the electronic structure. We find that the hydrated proton forms a fluxional defect in the hydrogen-bonded network, with both H9O4+ and H5O2+ occurring only in thesense of 'limiting' or 'ideal' structures. The defect can become delocalized over several hydrogen bonds owing to quantum fluctuations. Solvent polarization induces a small barrier to proton transfer, which is washed out by zero-point motion. The proton can consequently be considered part of a 'low-barrier hydrogen bond', , in which tunnelling is negligible and the simplest concepts of transition-state theory do not apply. The rate of proton diffusion is determined by thermally induced hydrogen-bond breaking in the second solvation shell.},

abstract = {The molecular dynamics of the silanols of high surface-area silica gel was studied using solid-state deuterium NMR spectroscopy. Deuterated silica gel samples were prepared by replacement of the exchangable silanol protons upon exposure to liquid 2H2O and subsequent dehydration under vacuum at various temperatures that were selected to provide samples with varying populations of specific surface features, including (a) "isolated" silanols, that is, those that are not hydrogen-bonded (as demonstrated by the 1H NMR chemical shift), (b) hydrogen-bonded silanols with a wide range of hydrogen-bonding strengths (as shown by the broad 1H NMR peak), and (c) a hydrogen-bonded network of physisorbed water. On a highly dehydrated surface obtained by dehydration at 500 °C and containing only isolated silanols, analysis of the deuterium line shapes indicates that the "isolated" silanols exhibit a broad, inhomogeneous distribution of librational amplitudes of O-H entities about the internuclear Si-O vector, all in the fast-exchange limit (with reference to a 5 x 10 -6 s time scale defined by deuterium quadrupole interactions). The librational amplitudes depend on the observation temperature: increasing amplitudes with increasing temperature and vice versa. At the lowest observation temperature of 78 K, a small part of the silanols is essentially immobilized, but a sizable fraction remains mobile. At dehydration temperatures of 150 and 300 °C, the silica surface contains silanols with a distribution of hydrogen-bond strengths. At each observation temperature, the heterogeneous population of hydrogen-bonded silanols exhibits a broader distribution of librational amplitudes than those exhibited by the "isolated" silanols at the same observation temperature. Less-aggressive dehydration conditions, for example, dehydration temperatures of 25 and 75 °C, creates samples in which, in addition to the silanols, a significant amount of physisorbed (deuterated) water is present. At lower observation temperatures, the effect of this physisorbed water is to narrow the librational amplitude for all of the silanols and water molecules. At the lowest observation temperature of 78 K, most of the surface silanols and water molecules of silica gel dehydrated at 25 and 75 °C are essentially immobilized. For silica gel dehydrated at 25 and 75 °C, at observation temperatures of 200 K and above, chemical exchange among a fraction of the surface silanols becomes significant, resulting in highly narrowed line shapes, while a substantial fraction of the surface silanols continue to execute the librational motions characteristic of more dehydrated surfaces. Line-shape analysis of the librational motion of the silanols permits the estimation of 121 ± 1° as the Si-O-2H bond angle. The deuterium quadrupole coupling constant of the silanol hydrogens is found to vary with the dehydration conditions and is interpreted as reflecting variations of the ensemble-averaged O-O distance between silanol oxygens and their various hydrogen-bonded partners. These data are interpreted in terms of a distribution of hydrogen-bonding arrangements on the heterogeneous silica surface, as witnessed by the silanols. This work provides an indirect indication that the popular view of a hydrogen bond (e.g., one with an O-O distance of 0.33 nm or less and with a nearly linear O-H-O arrangement) can be extended to admit a class of "weak" hydrogen bonds, for which the distance and geometry of the O-H-O triples are outside the typical view; but at such O-H-O configurations there are still significant interaction energies and molecular dynamics is affected. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {The Hall effect for dilute ionic solutions is potentially a valuable measure of ion‐solvent interactions. We express the intrinsic part of this effect, the ionic Hall number, exactly in terms of the perturbation made by the magnetic field on the memory function for the ionic momentum. By applying the resulting molecular theory in the Brownian ion‐continuum solvent (BICS) limit we calculate the ponderomotive force contribution and find that it depends not only on the hydrodynamic boundary conditions at the surface of the ion but also on the coupling of the vorticity field to the spin field in the solvent. Comparison of the results with an earlier theoretical study shows the advantages of the statistical mechanical approach compared to the approach through the electromagnetic hydrodynamic theory. The available experimental data related to the BICS limit are not accurate enough to test the theory.},

abstract = {X-ray and neutron diffractions, vibrational spectroscopy, and x-ray Raman scattering and absorption experiments on water are often interpreted in terms of hydrogen bonding. To this end a number of geometric definitions of hydrogen bonding in water have been developed. While all definitions of hydrogen bonding are to some extent arbitrary, those involving one distance and one angle for a given water dimer are unnecessarily so. In this paper the authors develop a systematic procedure based on two-dimensional potentials of mean force for defining cutoffs for a given pair of distance and angular coordinates. They also develop an electronic structure-based definition of hydrogen bonding in liquid water, related to the electronic occupancy of the antibonding OH orbitals. This definition turns out to be reasonably compatible with one of the distance-angle geometric definitions. These two definitions lead to an estimate of the number of hydrogen bonds per molecule in liquid simple point chargeextended (SPCE) water of between 3.2 and 3.4. They also used these and other hydrogen-bond definitions to examine the dynamics of local hydrogen-bond number fluctuations, finding an approximate long-time decay constant for SPCE water of between 0.8 and 0.9 ps, which corresponds to the time scale for local structural relaxation. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Institute of Physics.},

The use of double-resonance vibrational overtone excitation followed by energy-selective photofragmentation and laser-induced fluorescence detection of OH fragments allowed us to measure previously inaccessible rovibrational energies above the seventh OH-stretch overtone. Extension of the experimental approach to triple-resonance excitation provides access to rovibrational levels via transitions with significant transition dipole moments (mainly OH-stretch overtones) up to the dissociation threshold of the O-H bond. A collisionally assisted excitation scheme enables us to probe vibrations that are not readily accessible via pure laser excitation. Observation of the continuous absorption onset yields a precise value for the O-H bond dissociation threshold, 41 145.94 ± 0.15 cm-1. Finally, we detect long-lived resonances as sharp peaks in spectra above the dissociation threshold. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Royal Society.},

The tightly bound water associated with biologically important ions increases their apparent size. We define the apparent dynamic hydration number of an ion here as the number of tightly bound water molecules that must be assigned to the ion to explain its apparent molecular weight on a Sephadex{\textregistered} G-10 size exclusion column, and report the first accurate determination of tightly bound water for 23 ions of biological significance, including H+ and HO−. We also calculate the radius of the equivalent hydrated sphere (rh) for each ion. We find that the ratio of the hydrated volumes of two ions approximates the ratio of the square of the charges of the same two ions. Since the ‘ionic strength' of the solution also depends upon the square of the charges on the ions, our results suggest that ionic strength effects may largely arise from local effects related to the hydrated volume of the ion—that is, from space filling, osmotic, water activity, surface tension and hydration shell overlap effects rather than from long-range electric field effects.},

abstract = {We have studied the effects of intermolecular and intramolecular coupling on the C-O stretching vibration of CO adsorbed on Platinum (111) by means of femtosecond broadband vibrational sum frequency generation (VSFG). Resonant intermolecular coupling is investigated through the coverage dependence of the VSFG signal. The experimental observations can be accurately modeled as lateral coupling of the molecular transition dipole moments; this coupling is invoked in the nonlinear optical response model as a local field correction. The linear polarizability, which appears in this model, is modified by both the dipole-dipole coupling and the population of bridged adsorption sites. By extending the formalism to include these effects, we deduce a vibrational polarizability of 0.32 {\AA}3 from the data. Intramolecular coupling to the frustrated translational mode is observed as temperature dependence of the C-O stretch. The present data can be described either by pertubative or nonpertubative lineshape models from the literature. Measurements of the temperature dependence of the vibrational free induction decay indicate a population relaxation time T1 of (0.8±0.1) ps, in agreement with the observed low-temperature linewidth. Moreover, the ability of this time-domain method to discriminate spectral inhomogeneity yields clear evidence of the order-disorder transition near 275 K. Above this temperature an inhomogeneous linewidth component of (12±3) cm -1 is observed. This value allows us to estimate the structural heterogeneity of the disordered phase, which result agrees with published Monte Carlo simulations. {\textcopyright} 2004 American Institute of Physics.},

Furthermore, the coordination of K{\textless}sup{\textgreater}+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} or Na{\textless}sup{\textgreater}+{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} to carbonyls in the selectivity filter effectively decouples the vibrations of those carbonyls from the rest of the protein, creating local probes of the electrostatic environment.

abstract = {Water plays a critical role in the structure and function of proteins, although the experimental properties of water around protein structures are not well understood. The water can be classified by the separation from the protein surface into bulk water and hydration water. Hydration water interacts closely with the protein and contributes to protein folding, stability, and dynamics, as well as interacting with the bulk water. Water potential functions are often parametrized to fit bulk water properties because of the limited experimental data for hydration water. Therefore, the structural and energetic properties of the hydration water were assessed for 105 atomic resolution (≤ 1.0 {\AA}) protein crystal structures with a high level of hydration water by calculating the experimental water-protein radial distribution function or surface distribution function (SDF) and water radial distribution function (RDF). Two maxima are observed in SDF: the first maximum at a radius of 2.75 {\AA} reflects first shell and hydrogen bond interactions between protein and water, and the second maximum at 3.65 {\^{A}}reflects second shell and van der Waals interactions between water and nonpolar atoms of protein-forming clathrate-hydrate-like structures. Thus, the two shells do not overlap. The RDF showed the features of liquid water radier man solid ice. The first and second maxima of RDF at 2.75 and 4.5 {\AA}, respectively, are the same as for bulk water, but the peaks are sharper, indicating hydration water is more stable than bulk water. Both distribution functions are inversely correlated with the distribution of B factors (atomic thermal factors) for the waters, suggesting that the maxima reflect stable positions. Therefore, the average water structure near the protein surface has experimentally observable differences from bulk water. This analysis will help improve the accuracy for models of water on the protein surface by providing rigorous data for the effects of the apparent chemical potential of the water near a protein surface. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Chemical Society.},

We report a multiscale investigation of the bulk and surface of aqueous electrolyte solutions that extends from the atomic scale (using atomistic modeling) to nanoscopic length scales (using bulk and interfacial femtosecond second harmonic measurements) to the macroscopic scale (using surface tension experiments). Electrolytes induce orientational order at concentrations starting at 10 mM that causes nonspecific changes in the surface tension of dilute electrolyte solutions. Aside from ion-dipole interactions, collective hydrogen-bond interactions are crucial and explain the observed difference of a factor of 6 between light water and heavy water. 2016},

@article{DeCoursey1997,
abstract = {The voltage-activated H+ selective conductance of rat alveolar epithelial cells was studied using whole-cell and excised-patch voltage-clamp techniques. The effects of substituting deuterium oxide, D2O, for water, H2O, on both the conductance and the pH dependence of gating were explored. D+ was able to permeate proton channels, but with a conductance only about 50{\%} that of H+. The conductance in D2O was reduced more than could be accounted for by bulk solvent isotope effects (i.e., the lower mobility of D+ than H+), suggesting that D+ interacts specifically with the channel during permeation. Evidently the H+ or D+ current is not diffusion limited, and the H+ channel does not behave like a water-filled pore. This result indirectly strengthens the hypothesis that H+ (or D+) and not OH- is the ionic species carrying current. The voltage dependence of H- channel gating characteristically is sensitive to pH0 and pHi and was regulated by pD0 and pDi in an analogous manner. shifting 40 mV/U change in the pD gradient. The time constant of H+ current activation was about three times slower (T(act) was larger) in D2O than in H2O. The size of the isotope effect is consistent with deuterium isotope effects for proton abstraction reactions, suggesting that H+ channel activation requires deprotonation of the channel. In contrast, deactivation (T(tail)) was slowed only by a factor {\textless} or = 1.5 in D2O. The results are interpreted within the context of a model for the regulation of H+ channel gating by mutually exclusive protonation at internal and external sites (Cherny, V.V., V.S. Markin, and T.E. DeCoursey. 1995. J. Gen. Physiol. 105:861-896). Most of the kinetic effects of D2O can be explained if the pKa of the external regulatory site is approximately 0.5 pH U higher in D2O.},

abstract = {Ultrafast infrared transient absorption measurements of the complete hydroxyl OD stretching mode spectrum of HOD in water, from 100 fs to tens of picoseconds, observe hydrogen bond breaking and monitor the equilibration of the hydrogen bond network in water. In addition, the vibrational lifetime, the time constant for hydrogen bond breaking, and the rate of orientational relaxation are determined. The reactant and photoproduct spectra of the hydrogen bond breaking process are identified by decomposing the transient spectra into two components, the initial spectrum associated with vibrational excited states (reactants) and the long-time spectrum associated with broken hydrogen bonds (photoproducts). By properly taking into account the perturbation of the reactant spectrum decay by the growth of the photoproduct spectrum, it is found that the vibrational relaxation (1.45 ps) and orientational relaxation (1.53 ps) are wavelength independent and, therefore, independent of the degree of hydrogen bonding. Energy deposited into water by vibrational relaxation does not immediately break a hydrogen bond by predissociation nor produce a thermally equilibrated hydrogen bond distribution at an elevated temperature. Following deposition of energy by vibrational relaxation, the hydrogen bond breaking time is 800 fs, and there is a transient period of several picoseconds during which the hydrogen bond distribution is not in thermal equilibrium.},

The spectra could be adequately described by a single Cole-Cole (CC) process, symmetrically broadened relative to that of pure water. However, similar quality fits were also obtained with a three-Debye-process (3D) model consisting of a small ion-pair contribution at lower frequencies and two solvent relaxations at higher frequencies. Assuming the ions to be solvent separated, the 3D model provided estimates of their association constants and their rate constants for formation and dissociation. The bulk water relaxation times obtained from both models showed almost no dependence on the nature of the anion. Nevertheless, there were subtle differences in the concentration dependences of the relaxation times which correlated with some, but not all, of the anion properties that are believed to be relevant for explaining the anionic Hofmeister series. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Chemical Society.},

The main quantity of interest is the "minimum slope" of the alpha dielectric loss plotted as a function of frequency in a log-log plot, i.e., the numerically largest slope above the loss peak frequency. The data consisting of 347 spectra for 53 liquids show prevalence of minimum slopes close to -1/2, corresponding to approximate square root(t) dependence of the dielectric relaxation function at short times. The paper studies possible correlations between minimum slopes and (1) temperature (quantified via the loss peak frequency); (2) how well an inverse power-law fits data above the loss peak; (3) degree of time-temperature superposition; (4) loss peak half width; (5) deviation from non-Arrhenius behavior; (6) loss strength. For the first three points we find correlations that show a special status of liquids with minimum slopes close to -1/2. For the last three points only fairly insignificant correlations are found, with the exception of large-loss liquids that have minimum slopes that are numerically significantly larger than 1/2. We conclude that--excluding large-loss liquids--approximate square root(t) relaxation appears to be a generic property of the alpha relaxation of organic glass formers.},

Mechanistic scenarios proposed previously are critically reviewed with the help of the presolvation concept, which provides a unifying framework for understanding charge migration mechanisms in hydrogen-bonded networks. It is argued that OH(-)(aq) features a nonclassical, in the Lewis sense, hypercoordinated solvation structure. The resulting mechanism deviates substantially from the traditional "mirror image" picture. Within the presolvation concept, it can also be suggested why alternative scenarios are inconsistent with experimental data.},

A remaining key question is how many hydration shells are affected by ion-induced network perturbations. We disclose that theoretical THz difference spectra of aqueous salt solutions can be deciphered in terms of only a handful of dipolar auto- and cross-correlations, including the second solvation shell. This emphasizes the importance of cross-correlations being often neglected in multicomponent models. Analogously, experimental THz responses of simple ions can be deciphered in a similar way. Dramatic intensity cancellations due to large positive and negative contributions are found to effectively shift intensity maxima. Thus, THz spectroscopy provides an unprecedented view on the details of hydration dynamics, which can be understood by a combination of experiment and t...},

The smaller lithium ion is more strongly hydrated, most probably with a second hydration shell present.

abstract = {Waiting time dependent rotational anisotropies of SCN(-) anions and water molecules in alkali thiocyanate (XSCN, X = Li, Na, K, Cs) aqueous solutions at various concentrations were measured with ultrafast infrared spectroscopy. It was found that cations can significantly affect the reorientational motions of both water molecules and SCN(-) anions. The dynamics are slower in a solution with a smaller cation. The reorientational time constants follow the order of Li(+) {\textgreater} Na(+) {\textgreater} K(+) {\~{}}/= Cs(+). The changes of rotational time constants of SCN(-) at various concentrations scale almost linearly with the changes of solution viscosity, but those of water molecules do not. In addition, the concentration-dependent amplitudes of dynamical changes are much more significant in the Li(+) and Na(+) solutions than those in the K(+) and Cs(+) solutions. Further investigations on the systems with the ultrafast vibrational energy exchange method and molecular dynamics simulations provide an explanation for the observations: the observed rotational dynamics are the balanced results of ion clustering and cation/anion/water direct interactions. In all the solutions at high concentrations ({\textgreater}5 M), substantial amounts of ions form clusters. The structural inhomogeneity in the solutions leads to distinct rotational dynamics of water and anions. The strong interactions of Li(+) and Na(+) because of their relatively large charge densities with water molecules and SCN(-) anions, in addition to the likely geometric confinements because of ion clustering, substantially slow down the rotations of SCN(-) anions and water molecules inside the ion clusters. The interactions of K(+) and Cs(+) with water or SCN(-) are much weaker. The rotations of water molecules inside ion clusters of K(+) and Cs(+) solutions are not significantly different from those of other water species so that the experimentally observed rotational relaxation dynamics are only slightly affected by the ion concentrations.},

The energy associated with both the weak and strong bonds of the configuration RO-H - OR2 is obtained through application of this function. A repulsive Van der Waals potential and an attractive electrostatic potential are also assumed to exist between the two electronegative atoms of the hydrogen bond. Through application of the conditions describing a stable equilibrium, relations are obtained which permit a calculation of OH frequency shifts, OH bonded distances, hydrogen bond energies and kO - O force constants, all as a function of the O - O distance R. The calculated quantities agree well with those obtained from neutron diffraction, infrared, and other experimental studies. Because of the assumptions involved, this model is best used to describe the properties of hydrogen bonds in crystals. The model is also capable of extention to describe the properties of other types of hydrogen bonds such as HFH, NHN, NHO, OHN, etc.},

Proton dynamics is susceptible to quantum tunnelling, which typically involves many hydrogen bonds simultaneously, lead- ing to correlated many-body tunnelling6–9 . In contrast to the well-studied incoherent single-particle tunnelling, our understanding of many-body tunnelling is still in its infancy. Herewe report the real-space observation of concerted proton tunnelling in a cyclicwater tetramerusing a cryogenic scanning tunnelling microscope. This is achieved by monitoring the reversible interconversion of the hydrogen-bonding chirality of the water tetramer with a chlorine-terminated scanning tunnelling microscope tip.We found that the presence of the Cl anion at the tip apex may either enhance or suppress the concerted tunnelling process, depending on the details of the coupling symmetry between the Cl ion and the protons. Our work opens up the possibility of controlling the quantum states of protons with atomic-scale precision.},

abstract = {Abstract The $\alpha$-dispersion in many polymer systems is the process to be associated with the glass transition temperature where many physical properties undergo drastic changes. We have measured and analyzed the complex dielectric behavior of the $\alpha$-dispersions for five polymers [i.e., polycarbonate and polyisophthalate esters of bisphenol A, isotactic poly-(methyl methacrylate), poly(methyl acrylate), and a copolymer of phenyl methacrylate and acrylonitrile] and have found that the usual methods of analysis cannot be used to represent the data. However, it is possible to represent the relaxation process as the sum of two dispersions but there is no evidence to support this contention. An empirical expression is proposed to represent the data. This expression which takes the form of $\backslash$documentclass{\{}article{\}}$\backslash$pagestyle{\{}empty{\}}$\backslash$begin{\{}document{\}}{\$}{\$} [$\backslash$varepsilon {\^{}}* ($\omega$) - $\backslash$varepsilon {\_}$\backslash$infty]/[$\backslash$varepsilon {\_}0 - $\backslash$varepsilon {\_}$\backslash$infty] = [1 + ($\iota$$\omega$$\tau${\_}0){\^{}}{\{}1 - $\alpha${\}}]{\^{}}{\{} - $\beta${\}} {\$}{\$}$\backslash$end{\{}document{\}} appears to be a general representation for the three known dispersions, i.e., Debye, circular arc, and skewed semicircle.

This method of representation was extended to sixteen $\alpha$-dispersions reported in the literature always with excellent results.},

@article{Persson2010,
abstract = {The hydration reaction is defined as the transfer of an ion or neutral chemical species from the gaseous phase into water, M n+(g) ? M n+ (aq). In this process, water molecules bind to metal ions through ion-dipole bonds of mainly electrostatic character. The hydration reaction is always strongly exothermic with increa sing heat of hydration with increasing charge density of the ion. The structures of the hydrated metal ions in aqueous solution display a variety of configurations depending on the size and electronic properties of the metal ion. The basic configurations of hydrated metal ions in aqueous solution are tetrahedral, octahedral, square antiprismatic, and tricapped trigonal prismatic. This paper gives an overview of the structures of hydrated metal ions in aqueous solution with special emphasis on those with a non-regular coordination figure. Metal ions without d-electrons in the valance shell form regular aqua complexes with a coordination figure, allowing a maximum number of water molecules to be clustered around the metal ion. This number is dependent on the ratio of the metal ion radius to the atomic radius of oxygen in a coordinated water molecule (1.34 {\AA}). The lighter lanthanoid(III) ions have a regular tricapped trigonal prismatic configuration with the M-O distance to the capping water molecules somewhat longer than to the prismatic ones. However, with increasing atomic number of the lanthanoid( III) ions, an increasing distortion of the capping water molecules is observed, resulting in a partial loss of water molecules in the capping positions for the heaviest lanthanoids. Metal ions with d 4 and d 9 valance shell electron configuration, as chromium(II) and copper( II), respectively, have Jahn-Teller distorted aqua complexes. Metal ions with low charge and ability to form strong covalent bonds, as silver(I), mercury(II), palladium(II), and platinum( II), often display distorted coordination figures due to the second-order Jahn-Teller effect. Metal ions with d 10s 2 valence shell electron configuration may have a stereochemically active lone electron pair (hemi-directed complexes) or an inactive one (holo-directed). The hydrated tin(II), lead(II), and thallium(I) ions are hemi-directed in aqueous solution, while the hydrated bismuth(III) ion is holo-directed. The structures of the hydrated cationic oxometal ions are reported as well. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2010 IUPAC, Publication date (Web): 19 June 2010.},

abstract = {Measurements of the conductance of HCl in water, methanol, ethanol,n‐propanol, ethylene glycol, glycerol, 1:4 dioxane, acetone, formic, and acetic acids and the respective aqueous‐nonaqueous systems have been made as a function of concentration of water and HCl. The degree of anomalous protonconductance decreases with increasing n in C n H2n+1OH, and conductance minima occur in aqueous alcoholic HCl solutions of low H2O content. Former theories of protonconductance have permitted no quantitative distinction to be made between the rates of classical proton transfer, quantum‐mechanical tunneling transfer, and water rotation as rate determining stages. If resonance in H3O{\textperiodcentered} is set up sufficiently quickly after arrival of a given proton at a water molecule, rotation of H3O{\textperiodcentered} cannot be a rate determining step. Detailed calculations of the rates of classical proton transfer, tunnel transfer, and the rate of rotation of water are made. Classical transfer is much slower and tunnel transfer much faster than corresponds to the observed protonmobility; rotation of hydrogen bonded water molecules near the H3O{\textperiodcentered} ion is the rate determining reaction (preceded and succeeded by fast tunneling of protons). This conclusion is quantitatively consistent with the OH′ mobility in water, and the H{\textperiodcentered}/D{\textperiodcentered}mobility ratio and qualitatively consistent with pressure and temperature effects and with the absence of abnormal mobility of NH4 {\textperiodcentered} and NH2′ in liquid NH3. A detailed interpretation of the dependence of abnormal conductance upon chain length in ROH gives fair quantitative agreement with experiment. The conductance minima observed in aqueous alcoholic HCl are quasi‐quantitatively predicted by the theory. The proton spends about 1{\%} of its time undergoing tunnel transfers; the effective existence of the H3O{\textperiodcentered} ion is thus confirmed.},

The spectra indicate, as for MgSO4(aq) studied previously, the simultaneous presence of double solvent-separated, solvent-shared and contact ion pairs in both NiSO 4(aq) and CoSO4(aq). The stepwise formation constants for each ion-pair type and the overall association constant, obtained from the data are in good agreement with ultrasonic relaxation and other estimates. The DR spectra at higher concentrations (c ≥ 0.5 mol-L-1) suggest the existence of a nonlinear triple ion M2SO42+(aq). Consistent with the very strong hydration of the salts, which have 'effective' hydration numbers approaching 27 at infinite dilution, there are no significant differences in any of the relaxation or thermodynamic parameters for NiSO4(aq) and CoSO4(aq), except that the triple ion appears to be somewhat more stable for the latter. {\textcopyright} 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.},

The neutralization step once the solvated ions are in close proximity is phenomenologically understood to be fast, but the molecular mechanism has not been directly probed by experiments. We elucidate the mechanism of recombination in liquid water with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, and it emerges as quite different from the conventional view of the Grotthuss mechanism. The neutralization event involves a collective compression of the water-wire bridging the ions, which occurs in approximately 0.5{\~{}}ps, triggering a concerted triple jump of the protons. This process leaves the neutralized hydroxide in a hypercoordinated state, with the implications that enhanced collective compressions of several water molecules around similarly hypercoordinated states are likely to serve as nucleation events for the autoionization of liquid water.},

Their formation via aqueous-phase reactions of phenol with the nitronium ion, NO2+, arising from N2O5 and ClNO2 partitioning into the aqueous phase, has been proposed but not verified experimentally. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that gaseous N2O5 and ClNO2 partitioning into dilute aqueous solutions of phenol yields 2- and 4-nitrophenol (and 4-nitrosophenol), but no dinitrophenol isomers. The rate of nitration does not vary significantly between 5 and 20 °C, presumably because of opposing temperature dependences in Henry's law partitioning and reaction rate coefficients. The rate coefficient for reaction of NO2+ with phenol could not be directly quantified but is evidently large enough for this reaction to compete effectively with the reaction between NO2+ and water and to provide a feasible route to nitrophenol production in the atmosphere. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We present the Gaussian and plane waves (GPW) method and its implementation in Quickstep which is part of the freely available program package CP2K. The GPW method allows for accurate density functional calculations in gas and condensed phases and can be effectively used for molecular dynamics simulations. We show how derivatives of the GPW energy functional, namely ionic forces and the Kohn-Sham matrix, can be computed in a consistent way. The computational cost of computing the total energy and the Kohn-Sham matrix is scaling linearly with the system size, even for condensed phase systems of just a few tens of atoms. The efficiency of the method allows for the use of large Gaussian basis sets for systems up to 3000 atoms, and we illustrate the accuracy of the method for various basis sets in gas and condensed phases. Agreement with basis set free calculations for single molecules and plane wave based calculations in the condensed phase is excellent. Wave function optimisation with the orbital transformation technique leads to good parallel performance, and outperforms traditional diagonalisation methods. Energy conserving Born-Oppenheimer dynamics can be performed, and a highly efficient scheme is obtained using an extrapolation of the density matrix. We illustrate these findings with calculations using commodity PCs as well as supercomputers. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The ion induced modification to the tetrahedral structure of water is a topic of much current interest. We address this question by interpreting neutron diffraction data from monovalent ionic solutions of NaCl and KCl using a computer assisted structural modeling technique. We investigate the effect that these ions have on the water-water O-O, O-H and H-H radial distribution functions as a function of ionic concentration. It is found that the O-H and H-H functions are only marginally affected by ionic composition, signaling that hydrogen bonding between water molecules remains largely intact, even at the highest concentrations. On the other hand the O-O functions are strongly modified by the ions. In particular the position of the second peak in g OO(r), is found to move inwards with increasing salt concentration, in a manner closely analogous to what happens in pure water under pressure. Furthermore by recalculating gOO(r) after excluding all the water molecules in the first hydration shell of each ion, we show that this structural perturbation exists outside the first hydration shell of the ions. {\textcopyright} the Owner Societies.},

abstract = {Szent-Gyorgi called water the "matrix of life" and claimed that there was no life without it. This statement is true, as far as we know, on our planet, but it is not clear whether it must hold throughout the cosmos. To evaluate that question requires a close consideration of the many varied and subtle roles that water plays in living cells - a consideration that must be free of both an assumed essentialism that gives water an almost mystical life-giving agency and a traditional tendency to see it as a merely passive solvent. Water is a participant in the "life of the cell," and here I describe some of the features of that active agency. Water's value for molecular biology comes from both the structural and dynamic characteristics of its status as a complex, structured liquid as well as its nature as a polar, protic, and amphoteric reagent. Any discussion of water as life's matrix must, however, begin with an acknowledgment that our understanding of it as both a liquid and a solvent is still incomplete.},

abstract = {Ultrafast infrared transient absorption measurements of the complete hydroxyl OD stretching mode spectrum of HOD in water, from 100 fs to tens of picoseconds, observe hydrogen bond breaking and monitor the equilibration of the hydrogen bond network in water. In addition, the vibrational lifetime, the time constant for hydrogen bond breaking, and the rate of orientational relaxation are determined. The reactant and photoproduct spectra of the hydrogen bond breaking process are identified by decomposing the transient spectra into two components, the initial spectrum associated with vibrational excited states (reactants) and the long-time spectrum associated with broken hydrogen bonds (photoproducts). By properly taking into account the perturbation of the reactant spectrum decay by the growth of the photoproduct spectrum, it is found that the vibrational relaxation (1.45 ps) and orientational relaxation (1.53 ps) are wavelength independent and, therefore, independent of the degree of hydrogen bonding. Energy deposited into water by vibrational relaxation does not immediately break a hydrogen bond by predissociation nor produce a thermally equilibrated hydrogen bond distribution at an elevated temperature. Following deposition of energy by vibrational relaxation, the hydrogen bond breaking time is 800 fs, and there is a transient period of several picoseconds during which the hydrogen bond distribution is not in thermal equilibrium.},

abstract = {When a solute is dissolved in water, their mutual interactions determine the molecular properties of the solute on one hand, and the structure and dynamics of the surrounding water particles (the so-called hydration water) on the other. The very existence of soft matter and its peculiar properties are largely due to the wide variety of possible water-solute interactions. In this context, water is not an inert medium but rather an active component, and hydration water plays a crucial role in determining the structure, stability, dynamics, and function of matter. This review focuses on the collective dynamics of hydration water in terms of retardation with respect to the bulk, and of the number of molecules whose dynamics is perturbed. Since water environments are in a dynamic equilibrium, with molecules continuously exchanging from around the solute towards the bulk and vice versa, we examine the ability of different techniques to measure the water dynamics on the basis of the explored time scales and exchange rates. Special emphasis is given to the collective dynamics probed by extended depolarized light scattering and we discuss whether and to what extent the results obtained in aqueous solutions of small molecules can be extrapolated to the case of large biomacromolecules. In fact, recent experiments performed on solutions of increasing complexity clearly indicate that a reductionist approach is not adequate to describe their collective dynamics. We conclude this review by presenting current ideas that are being developed to describe the dynamics of water interacting with macromolecules.},

@article{Pomes2002,
abstract = {The conduction of protons in the hydrogen-bonded chain of water molecules (or “proton wire”) embedded in the lumen of gramicidin A is studied with molecular dynamics free energy simulations. The process may be described as a “hop-and-turn” or Grotthuss mechanism involving the chemical exchange (hop) of hydrogen nuclei between hydrogen-bonded water molecules arranged in single file in the lumen of the pore, and the subsequent reorganization (turn) of the hydrogen-bonded network. Accordingly, the conduction cycle is modeled by two complementary steps corresponding respectively to the translocation 1) of an ionic defect (H+) and 2) of a bonding defect along the hydrogen-bonded chain of water molecules in the pore interior. The molecular mechanism and the potential of mean force are analyzed for each of these two translocation steps. It is found that the mobility of protons in gramicidin A is essentially determined by the fine structure and the dynamic fluctuations of the hydrogen-bonded network. The translocation of H+ is mediated by spontaneous (thermal) fluctuations in the relative positions of oxygen atoms in the wire. In this diffusive mechanism, a shallow free-energy well slightly favors the presence of the excess proton near the middle of the channel. In the absence of H+, the water chain adopts either one of two polarized configurations, each of which corresponds to an oriented donor-acceptor hydrogen-bond pattern along the channel axis. Interconversion between these two conformations is an activated process that occurs through the sequential and directional reorientation of water molecules of the wire. The effect of hydrogen-bonding interactions between channel and water on proton translocation is analyzed from a comparison to the results obtained previously in a study of model nonpolar channels, in which such interactions were missing. Hydrogen-bond donation from water to the backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms lining the pore interior has a dual effect: it provides a coordination of water molecules well suited both to proton hydration and to high proton mobility, and it facilitates the slower reorientation or turn step of the Grotthuss mechanism by stabilizing intermediate configurations of the hydrogen-bonded network in which water molecules are in the process of flipping between their two preferred, polarized states. This mechanism offers a detailed molecular model for the rapid transport of protons in channels, in energy-transducing membrane proteins, and in enzymes.},

If, however, the translational diffusion of these molecules is also taken into account, dielectric relaxation is accelerated. This results in the lowering of the dielectric friction that retards the motion of an ion or dipole in a dielectric. This reduction in dielectric friction is here calculated for two models: a time-dependent dipole at the center of a sphere, and a moving charge on the axis of a cylinder, each immersed in a dielectric. A parameter measuring the relative importance of rotation and diffusion is identified, and a substantial lowering of the dielectric friction is implied in many situations. It is shown that the boundary conditions play a decisive role in the properties of the fields. Directions for a further development of the theory of polarization diffusion are indicated.},

abstract = {Publisher Summary The chapter focuses on liquid junction potentials. Potentiometric methods of electroanalysis depend on the ability of a membrane material for transporting either cations or anions selectively. This selective behavior results in an imbalance of concentrations on either side of the membrane. In turn, it leads to the establishment of a measurable potential difference across the membrane. Lingane has delineated three types of diffusion potential, depending on the differences between the constituent parts of an electrolyte solution. The first potential arises when the entire solution consists of the same electrolyte but a difference in activities exists within the solution. The second type of boundary arises where two solutions containing a common ion meet the common-ion activities in both halves are identical but each half of the cell contains a different counter-ion. Finally, the third type of diffusion potential can be established when neither of the conditions of the first and the second type are met. Differing fractions of charge can be carried out by the components of a given electrolyte solution.},

We observe large fluctuations in the effective charges; protons can transport effective charges greater than +e for ultrashort time scales. Furthermore, we compare our results with a simpler model of ionic conductivity in water that is based on diffusion coefficients.

abstract = {Dynamics of water, especially in the temperature range of the no mans land, remain a mystery. We present detailed study of dynamics in aqueous LiCl solution that is often considered as a model for bulk water. We employ broadband dielectric and light scattering spectroscopy in a broad frequency and temperature range. Our analysis reveals no sign of the fragile-to-strong crossover (FSC) neither in structural relaxation nor in translational motions. Our experimental results combined with a large selection of literature data lead to the clear conclusion-there is no FSC in dynamics of aqueous solutions at T ∼ 200-230 K. Instead, our analysis reveals appearance of the so-called excess wing at the high frequency tail of the structural relaxation peak. We discuss the localized nature of the relaxation process that contributes to the excess wing. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Institute of Physics.},

@article{Roberts2011,
abstract = {While it is generally recognized that the hydroxide ion can rapidly diffuse through aqueous solution due to its ability to accept a proton from a neighboring water molecule, a description of the OH- solvation structure and mechanism of proton transfer to the ion remains controversial. In this report, we present the results of femtosecond infrared spectroscopy measurements of the O - H stretching transition of dilute HOD dissolved in NaOD/D2O. Pump - probe, photon echo peak shift, and two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy experiments performed as a function of deuteroxide concentration are used to assign spectral signatures that arise from the OH - ion and its solvation shell. A spectral feature that decays on a ̃110 fs time scale is assigned to the relaxation of transiently formed configurations wherein a proton is equally shared between a HOD molecule and an OD- ion. Over picosecond waiting times, features appear in 2D IR spectra that are indicative of the exchange of population between OH- ions and HOD molecules due to deuteron transfer. The construction of a spectral model that includes spectral relaxation, chemical exchange, and thermalization processes, and self-consistently treats all of our data, allows us to qualitatively explain the results of our experiments and gives a lower bound of 3 ps for the deuteron transfer kinetics. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {The dynamics of water and its effect on proton transport kinetics in Nafion membranes are compared at several hydration levels. Nafion is the most widely used polyelectrolyte membrane in fuel cells. Ultrafast infrared spectroscopy of the O-D stretch of dilute HOD in H2O provides a probe of the local environment and hydrogen bond network dynamics of water confined in the hydrophilic regions of Nafion. The kinetics of proton transfer in Nafion are tracked by following the excited-state proton transfer and recombination kinetics of a molecular probe, pyranine (HPTS). The hydrophilic domains of Nafion grow with increased hydration, and the interfacial regions reorganize, leading to a changing local environment for water near the interface. Swelling is not uniform throughout the membrane, and heterogeneity is observed in the fluorescence anisotropy decays of the methoxy derivative of pyranine. Measurements of the time-dependent anisotropy of water in Nafion provide a direct probe of the hydrogen bond network dynamics. These dynamics, as well as the rate of proton transport over nanoscopic distances, are observed to slow significantly as the hydration level of the membrane decreases. The results provide insights into the influence of changes in the dynamics of water on the proton-transfer processes. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the hydration structure of Na + and K + in the liquid phase has wide ranging implications in the field of biological chemistry. Despite numerous experimental and computational studies, even basic features such as the coordination number of these alkali ions in liquid water, thought to play a critical role in selectivity, continue to be the subject of intensive debates. Simulations based on accurate potential energy surfaces offer one approach to resolve these issues by providing reliable results on ion hydration. In this article, we report the results from molecular dynamics simulations of Na + and K + hydration based on a novel and rigorous strategy designed to overcome the challenges of QM/MM simulations of solvent molecules in the liquid phase. In this method, which we call Flexible Inner Region Ensemble Separator (FIRES), the ion and a fixed number of nearest water molecules form a dynamical and flexible inner region that is represented with high level ab initio quantum mechanical (QM) methods, while the water molecules from the surrounding bulk form an outer region that is represented by a polarizable molecular mechanical (MM) force field. Simulations yield rigorously correct thermodynamic averages as long as the solvent molecules in the flexible inner and outer regions are not allowed to exchange. Extensive FIRES simulations were carried out based on a QM/MM model in which the Na + or K + ion and the 12 nearest water molecules were represented by high level ab initio methods (RI-MP2/def2-TZVP and density functional theory with PBE/def2-TZVP), while the surrounding MM water molecules were represented by the polarizable SWM4-NDP potential. On the basis of these results, the ion coordination numbers are estimated to be within the range of 5.7-5.8 for Na + and 6.9-7.0 for K +. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {The neutron diffraction pattern of D2O ice was recently measured at pressures up to 52 GPa by Guthrie et al., who proposed an octahedral interstitial model for ice at pressures above 13 GPa to account for the deviation of the observed crystal structure from that of ice VII. In this article, the octahedral interstitial model was re-examined in terms of the interstitial occupancy and X-ray Raman spectroscopy (XRS) spectra. The interstitial occupancy calculated using first-principles molecular dynamics simulations was negligibly small compared to that of the interstitial model. The oxygen K-edge spectra calculated for the interstitial model exhibited two additional low-energy peaks originating from water molecules and hydroxides that are interacting with interstitial protons, respectively, whereas these low-energy peaks were not observed in the experimentally measured spectra. These results suggest that the interstitial model cannot explain the XRS spectra of ice VII at pressures above 13 GPa and that more precise structure measurements and analyses are necessary to reveal the nature of the pressure-induced transition.},

Differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction studies confirm minimum volume fraction of crystalline phase for the polymer electrolyte with 40 wt. {\%} propylene carbonate. The ionic conductivity exhibits a maximum for the same composition. The temperature dependence of the ionic conductivity has been well interpreted using Vogel-Tamman-Fulcher equation. Ion-ion interactions in the polymer electrolytes have been studied using Raman spectra and the concentrations of free ions, ion-pairs and ion-aggregates have been determined. The ionic conductivity increases due to the increase of free ions with the increase of propylene carbonate content. But for higher content of propylene carbonate, the ionic conductivity decreases due to the increase of concentrations of ion-pairs and ion-aggregates. To get further insights into the ion dynamics, the experimental data for the complex dielectric permittivity have been studied using Havriliak–Negami function. The variation of relaxation time with temperature obtained from this formalism follows Vogel-Tamman-Fulcher equation similar to the ionic conductivity.},

@article{Giammanco2012,
abstract = {Water hydrogen bond dynamics in concentrated salt solutions are studied using polarization-selective IR pump-probe spectroscopy and 2D IR vibrational echo spectroscopy performed on the OD hydroxyl stretching mode of dilute HOD in H2O/salt solutions. The OD stretch is studied to eliminate vibrational excitation transfer, which interferes with the dynamical measurements. Though previous research suggested that only the anion affected dynamics in solution, here it is shown that the cation plays a role as well. From FT-IR spectra of the OD stretch, it is seen that replacing either ion of the salt pair causes a shift in absorption frequency relative to that of the OD stretch absorption in bulk pure water. This shift becomes pronounced with larger, more polarizable anions or smaller, high charge-density cations. The vibrational lifetime of the OD hydroxyl stretch in these solutions is a local property and is primarily dependent on the nature of the anion and whether the OD is hydrogen bonded to the anion or to the oxygen of another water molecule. However, the cation still has a small effect. Time dependent anisotropy measurements show that reorientation dynamics in these concentrated solutions is a highly concerted process. While the lifetime, a local probe, displays an ion-associated and a bulk-like component in concentrated solutions, the orientational relaxation does not have two subensemble dynamics, as demonstrated by the lack of a wavelength dependence. The orientational relaxation of the single ensemble is dependent on the identity of both the cation and anion. The 2D IR vibrational echo experiments measure spectral diffusion that is caused by structural evolution of the system. The vibrational echo measurements yield the frequency-frequency correlation function (FFCF). The results also show that the structural dynamics are dependent on the cation as well as the anion. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {A discussion has been given of Onsager's theory of liquid dielectrics and of its application to experiment. It has been shown that if Onsager's theory is modified to include the effect of optical anisotropy, the deviations of the modified theory from agreement with experiment can be consistently correlated with a qualitative discussion of the influence of molecular structure on intermolecular association in polar liquids. This result is somewhat surprising in view of the possibility that the value of the reaction field calculated by Onsager is for actual liquids seriously in error. It is difficult to believe that the observed consistency between the experimental data and the interpretation given here is the result of coincidence; this possibility must nevertheless be kept in mind. If, however, the interpretation given here is correct, the application of Onsager's theory to dielectric constant data can be used to obtain qualitative or perhaps even semi-quantitative information regarding the nature of intermolecular association in polar liquids and solutions; for example, the results given in the present paper indicate that in liquid diethyl ether, ethyl alcohol, and water the molecules are associated in such a way that the effective mean square dipole moment is greater than that of a free molecule; in liquid aryl and alkyl monohalides, on the other hand, the effective mean square moment is less than that of a free molecule. {\textcopyright} 1939, American Chemical Society.

The field which acts upon a molecule in a polarized dielectric may be decomposed into a cavity field G, given by the shape of the molecule and proportional to the external field intensity, and a reaction field R, which is proportional to the total electric moment, and depends on the instantaneous orientation of the molecule. 3. The mean orientation of a molecule is determined by the orienting force-couple exerted by the cavity field G upon the electric moment of the molecule. The earlier naive application of the Mosotti formula is equivalent to the assumption that the effective orienting field equals the average of (G + R), and incorrect because R never exerts a torque upon the molecule. 4. Since all real molecules are electrically deformable, the reaction field R will cause an enhancement of the electric moment of any molecule immersed in a dielectric. The induced moment due to the cavity field G will be similarly enhanced by the corresponding component of R. {\textcopyright} 1936, American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.},

Debye-Falkenhagen (DF) suggested in 1929 that translational motion of any ion requires neighboring ions to readjust their relative positions.

Falkenhagen generated theoretical graphs showing a frequency dispersion of normalized conductance. Corresponding experimental data have never been reported. The present article considers the DF effect from an experimental standpoint. It is found that the predicted effect is extremely small in dilute electrolyte solutions. Impedance measurements on the water-p-dioxane and the methanol-toluene systems confirm this prediction. Both systems exhibit impedance dispersions entirely characterized by bulk dielectric constant and bulk conductance.},

The H-bond cleavage and the molecular reorientation occur concertedly and not successively as usually considered. This water reorientation mechanism involves large-amplitude angular jumps, rather than the commonly accepted sequence of small diffusive steps, and therefore calls for reinterpretation of many experimental data wherein water rotational relaxation is assumed to be diffusive.},

@article{Deak2000,
abstract = {In the broad water stretching band (2900-3700 cm-1). frequency-dependent vibrational energy relaxation (VER), and spectral diffusion both occur on the time scale of a few picoseconds. Ultrafast IR-Raman spectroscopy of water is used to study both processes. VER is also studied in solutions of HDO in D2O (HDO/D2O). The OH stretch ($\nu$OH) lifetime for water and HDO is ∼1 ps. The OD stretch ($\nu$OD) lifetime for D2O is ∼2 ps. Stretch decay generates substantial excitation of the bending modes. The lifetimes of bending vibrations ($\delta$) in H2O, HDO, and D2O can be estimated to be in the 0.6 ps ≤ T1 ≤ 1.2 ps range. $\nu$OH decay in water produces $\delta$H2o with a quantum yield 1.0 ≤ $\phi$ ≤ 2.0. In HDO/D2O solutions, $\nu$OH(HDO) decay generates $\nu$OD(D2O), $\delta$HDO, and $\delta$5D2o. The quantum yield for generating $\nu$OD(D2O) is $\phi$ ≈ 0.1. The quantum yield for generating both $\delta$HDO and $\delta$D2O is $\phi$ ≥ 0.6. Thus, each $\nu$OH(HDO) decay generates at minimum 1.2 quanta of bending excitation. After narrow-band pumping, the distribution of excitations within the stretch band of water evolves in time. Pumping on the blue edge instantaneously (within ∼1 ps) generates excitations throughout the band. Pumping on the red edge does not instantaneously generate excitations at the blue edge. Excitations migrate uphill to the blue edge on the 0-2 ps time scale. The fast downhill spectral diffusion is attributed to excitation hopping among water molecules in different structural environments. The slower uphill spectral diffusion is attributed to evolution of the local liquid structure. Shortly after excitations are generated, an overall redshift is observed that is attributed to a dynamic vibrational Stokes shift. This dynamic shift slows down the rate of excitation hopping. Then energy redistribution throughout the band becomes slow enough that the longer VER lifetimes of stretch excitations on the blue edge can lead to a gradual blue shift of population over the next few picoseconds. {\textcopyright} 2000 American Chemical Society.},

Here we show that unlike classical empirical potentials, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations successfully reproduce the qualitative trends observed experimentally. These types of phenomena have often been rationalized in terms of the "structure-making" or "structure-breaking" effects of different ions on the solvent, although the microscopic origins of these features have remained elusive. Rather than disrupting the network in a significant manner, the electrolytes studied here cause rather subtle changes in both structural and dynamical properties of water. In particular, we show that water in the ab initio molecular dynamics simulations is characterized by dynamic heterogeneity, which turns out to be critical in reproducing the experimental trends.},

A significant number of water exchanges between the first and second solvation shells are observed. However, the simulations are not long enough to reliably measure the rate of water exchange.

abstract = {The tertiary interactions between amide-I vibrators on the separate helices of transmembrane helix dimers were probed by ultrafast 2D vibrational photon echo spectroscopy. The 2D IR approach proves to be a useful structural method for the study of membrane-bound structures. The 27-residue human erythrocyte protein Glycophorin A transmembrane peptide sequence: KKITLIIFG 79VMAGVIGTILLISWG94IKK was labeled at G79 and G94 with 13C=16O or 13C= 18O. The isotopomers and their 50:50 mixtures formed helical dimers in SDS micelles whose 2D IR spectra showed components from homodimers when both helices had either 13C=16O or 13C= 18O substitution and a heterodimer when one had 13C= 16O substitution and the other had 13C=18O substitution. The cross-peaks in the pure heterodimer 2D IR difference spectrum and the splitting of the homodimer peaks in the linear IR spectrum show that the amide-I mode is delocalized across a pair of helices. The excitation exchange coupling in the range 4.3-6.3 cm-1 arises from through-space interactions between amide units on different helices. The angle between the two Gly79 amide-I transition dipoles, estimated at 103° from linear IR spectroscopy and 110° from 2D IR spectroscopy, combined with the coupling led to a structural picture of the hydrophobic interface that is remarkably consistent with results from MMR on helix dimers. The helix crossing angle in SDS is estimated at 45°. Two-dimensional IR spectroscopy also sets limits on the range of geometrical parameters for the helix dimers from an analysis of the coupling constant distribution. {\textcopyright} 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {We model ion solvation in water. We use the MB model of water, a simple two-dimensional statistical mechanical model in which waters are represented as Lennard-Jones disks having Gaussian hydrogen-bonding arms. We introduce a charge dipole into MB waters. We perform (NPT) Monte Carlo simulations to explore how water molecules are organized around ions and around nonpolar solutes in salt solutions. The model gives good qualitative agreement with experiments, including Jones-Dole viscosity B coefficients, Samoilov and Hirata ion hydration activation energies, ion solvation thermodynamics, and Setschenow coefficients for Hofmeister series ions, which describe the salt concentration dependence of the solubilities of hydrophobic solutes. The two main ideas captured here are (1) that charge densities govern the interactions of ions with water, and (2) that a balance of forces determines water structure: electrostatics (water's dipole interacting with ions) and hydrogen bonding (water interacting with neighboring waters). Small ions (kosmotropes) have high charge densities so they cause strong electrostatic ordering of nearby waters, breaking hydrogen bonds. In contrast, large ions (chaotropes) have low charge densities, and surrounding water molecules are largely hydrogen bonded.},

abstract = {The method of dispersion correction as an add-on to standard Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT-D) has been refined regarding higher accuracy, broader range of applicability, and less empiricism. The main new ingredients are atom-pairwise specific dispersion coefficients and cutoff radii that are both computed from first principles. The coefficients for new eighth-order dispersion terms are computed using established recursion relations. System (geometry) dependent information is used for the first time in a DFT-D type approach by employing the new concept of fractional coordination numbers (CN). They are used to interpolate between dispersion coefficients of atoms in different chemical environments. The method only requires adjustment of two global parameters for each density functional, is asymptotically exact for a gas of weakly interacting neutral atoms, and easily allows the computation of atomic forces. Three-body nonadditivity terms are considered. The method has been assessed on standard benchmark sets for inter- and intramolecular noncovalent interactions with a particular emphasis on a consistent description of light and heavy element systems. The mean absolute deviations for the S22 benchmark set of noncovalent interactions for 11 standard density functionals decrease by 15{\%}-40{\%} compared to the previous (already accurate) DFT-D version. Spectacular improvements are found for a tripeptide-folding model and all tested metallic systems. The rectification of the long-range behavior and the use of more accurate C6 coefficients also lead to a much better description of large (infinite) systems as shown for graphene sheets and the adsorption of benzene on an Ag(111) surface. For graphene it is found that the inclusion of three-body terms substantially (by about 10{\%}) weakens the interlayer binding. We propose the revised DFT-D method as a general tool for the computation of the dispersion energy in molecules and solids of any kind with DFT and related (low-cost) electronic structure methods for large systems. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Institute of Physics.},

@article{Eaves2005,
abstract = {Although it is widely accepted that the local structure of liquid water has tetrahedral arrangements of molecules ordered by hydrogen bonds, the mechanism by which water molecules switch hydrogen-bonded partners remains unclear. In this mechanism, the role of nonhydrogen-bonded configurations (NHBs) between adjacent molecules is of particular importance. A molecule may switch hydrogen-bonding partners either (i) through thermally activated breaking of a hydrogen bond that creates a dangling hydrogen bond before finding a new partner or (ii) by infrequent but rapid switching events in which the NHB is a transition state. Here, we report a combination of femtosecond 2D IR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the stability of NHB species in an isotopically dilute mixture of HOD in D2O. Measured 2D IR spectra reveal that hydrogen-bonded configurations and NHBs undergo qualitatively different relaxation dynamics, with NHBs returning to hydrogen-bonded frequencies on the time scale of water's fastest intermolecular motions. Simulations of an atomistic model for the OH vibrational spectroscopy of water yield qualitatively similar 2D IR spectra to those measured experimentally. Analysis of NHBs in simulations by quenching demonstrates that the vast majority of NHBs are in fact part of a hydrogen-bonded well of attraction and that virtually all molecules return to a hydrogen-bonding partner within 200 fs. The results from experiment and simulation demonstrate that NHBs are intrinsically unstable and that dangling hydrogen bonds are an insignificant species in liquid water. {\textcopyright} 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {Gramicidin A (gA) molecules were covalently linked with a dioxolane ring. Dioxolane-linked gA dimers formed ion channels, selective for monovalent cations, in planar lipid bilayers. The main goal of this study was to compare the functional single ion channel properties of natural gA and its covalently linked dimer in two different lipid bilayers and HCl concentrations (10–8000 mM). Two ion channels with different gating and conductance properties were identified in bilayers from the product of dimerization reaction. The most commonly observed and most stable gramicidin A dimer is the main object of this study. This gramicidin dimer remained in the open state most of the time, with brief closing flickers (tau(closed) approximately 30 micros). The frequency of closing flickers increased with transmembrane potential, making the mean open time moderately voltage dependent (tau(open) changed approximately 1.43-fold/100 mV). Such gating behavior is markedly different from what is seen in natural gA channels. In PEPC (phosphatidylethanolamine-phosphatidylcholine) bilayers, single-channel current-voltage relationships had an ohmic behavior at low voltages, and a marked sublinearity at relatively higher voltages. This behavior contrasts with what was previously described in GMO (glycerylmonooleate) bilayers. In PEPC bilayers, the linear conductance of single-channel proton currents at different proton concentrations was essentially the same for both natural and gA dimers. g(max) and K(D), obtained from fitting experimental points to a Langmuir adsorption isotherm, were approximately 1500 pS and 300 mM, respectively, for both the natural gA and its dimer. In GMO bilayers, however, proton affinities of gA and the dioxolane-dimer were significantly lower (K(D) of approximately 1 and 1.5 M, respectively), and the g(max) higher (approximately 1750 and 2150 pS, respectively) than in PEPC bilayers. Furthermore, the relationship between single-channel conductance and proton concentration was linear at low bulk concentrations of H+ (0.01–2 M) and saturated at concentrations of more than 3 M. It is concluded that 1) The mobility of protons in gramicidin A channels in different lipid bilayers is remarkably similar to proton mobilities in aqueous solutions. In particular, at high concentrations of HCl, proton mobilities in gramicidin A channel and in solution differ by only 25{\%}. 2) Differences between proton conductances in gramicidin A channels in GMO and PEPC cannot be explained by surface charge effects on PEPC membranes. It is proposed that protonated phospholipids adjacent to the mouth of the pore act as an additional source of protons for conduction through gA channels in relation to GMO bilayers. 3) Some experimental results cannot be reconciled with simple alterations in access resistance to proton flow in gA channels. Said differences could be explained if the structure and/or dynamics of water molecules inside gramicidin A channels is modulated by the lipid environment and by modifications in the structure of gA channels. 4) The dioxolane ring is probably responsible for the closing flickers seen in the dimer channel. However, other factors can also influence closing flickers.},

The hydrate spectra and species abundances were obtained as a function of total concentrations. From this the equilibrium equation between the two ammonia hydrates was determined: 2[(NH3)2{\textperiodcentered}H2O]+5(H2O) 2{\^{a}}‡{\OE}4[NH3{\textperiodcentered}3H2O] with its equilibrium constant K$\alpha$ = (2.3 ± 0.6) × 10-5 L3 mol-3. Similarly, for the two ammonium chloride hydrates the equation is 2[(NH4Cl)2{\textperiodcentered}H 2O]+5(H2O)2{\^{a}}‡{\OE}4[NH 4Cl{\textperiodcentered}3H2O] with its equilibrium constant: K $\beta$ = (4 ± 1) × 10-7 L3 mol-3. Band simulations of the hydrate spectra were compared to that of pure liquid water and parent molecules. For aqueous ammonium chloride solutions the water and all ammonium hydrate bands are slightly displaced from that of pure water and pure ammonium chloride, respectively. However, for ammonia hydrates the situation is different: compared to the gas situation the hydrate water bands have similar displacements as that of pure liquid water; the ammonia deformation bands are also little displaced but the stretching bands are strongly red shifted. These shifts, which are even greater than that in pure liquid water, are attributed to strong hydrogen bonding situations: water-H with N-ammonia and ammonia-H with O-water. This explains the high solubility of ammonia in water. The comparison between the spectra of aqueous ammonium chloride and ammonia hydrates indicates that ammonium ion is not present in aqueous ammonia from 11.3 M down to at least our detection limit of 3 mM NH 3. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {One of the difficulties in unravelling transport processes in electrically insulating materials is the fact that the response, notably charging current transients, can have mixed contributions from orientation polarization and from space charge processes. This work aims at identifying and characterizing the polarization processes in a polar polymer in the time and frequency-domains and to implement the contribution of the polarization into a charge transport model. To do so, Alternate Polarization Current (APC) and Dielectric Spectroscopy measurements have been performed on poly(ethylene naphthalene 2,6-dicarboxylate) (PEN), an aromatic polar polymer, providing information on polarization mechanisms in the time- and frequency-domain, respectively. In the frequency-domain, PEN exhibits 3 relaxation processes termed b, b* (sub-glass transitions), and a relaxations (glass transition) in increasing order of temperature. Conduction was also detected at high temperatures. Dielectric responses were treated using a simplified version of the Havriliak- Negami model (Cole-Cole (CC) model), using 3 parameters per relaxation process, these parame- ters being temperature dependent. The time dependent polarization obtained from the CC model is then added to a charge transport model. Simulated currents issued from the transport model implemented with the polarization are compared with the measured APCs, showing a good consistency between experiments and simulations in a situation where the response comes essentially from dipolar processes.},

By resonantly exciting the O-H+-stretching mode of the H9O4(+) (Eigen) hydration structure of the proton and probing the subsequent absorption change over a broad frequency range, the dynamics of the proton is observed in real time. The lifetime of the protonic stretching mode is found to be approximately 120 fs, shorter than for any other vibration in liquid water. We also observe the interconversion between the H9O4(+) (Eigen) and H5O2(+) (Zundel) hydration structures of the proton.

abstract = {We have reviewed the mechanistic aspects regarding the direct aqueous phase environmental photochemistry of phenol and its simple halogenated derivatives. These compounds are important industrial and natural products, are ubiquitous in aquatic systems, and their acute and chronic toxicity makes their environmental fate of interest. Work over the past two decades has unified the photochemistry of phenol and its simple halogenated derivatives. In general, three photochemical pathways dominate in aqueous solution depending on the nature of the substrate: (1) photoionization, (2) photochemical aryl-halogen bond homolysis, and (3) photochemical aryl-halogen bond heterolysis. Photoionization typically results in an array of biaryl radical coupling products which are only relevant for highly concentrated waste streams. Photolytic aryl-halogen bond homolysis will primarily give photoreduction products where reducing agents such as dissolved organic matter or reduced metal cations are present, and radical coupling products in highly concentrated waste streams. The 2- and 4-substituted halophenols may undergo photochemical aryl-halogen bond heterolysis upon irradiation to give an aryl cation. The aryl cation can be attacked by water to give the corresponding hydroxylated derivative, or may deprotonate to generate $\alpha$- and $\gamma$-ketocarbenes, respectively. Following their formation, the singlet $\alpha$-ketocarbenes may undergo Wolff rearrangements to cyclopentadiene-ketenes that are subsequently hydrolyzed to cyclopentadiene carboxylic acids. The triplet $\alpha$- and $\gamma$-ketocarbenes are attacked by oxygen and hydrolyzed to give benzoquinones, directly hydrolyzed to yield hydroquinones, reduced to give phenols, or could take part in coupling reactions in highly concentrated waste streams to give dimers and hydroxybiaryl complexes. Additional studies in natural water samples are required to assess the relative importance of these direct irradiation mechanisms relative to indirect photolysis and other abiotic and biotic degradation and environmental partitioning pathways across the continuum of marine, freshwater, and wastewater biogeochemical signatures. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are considered to be a promising technology for clean and efficient power generation in the twenty-first century. Proton exchange membranes (PEMs) are the key components in fuel cell system. The researchers have focused to reach the proton exchange membrane with high proton conductivity, low electronic conductivity, low permeability to fuel, low electroosmotic drag coefficient, good chemical/thermal stability, good mechanical properties and low cost. These are classified into the "iron triangle" of performance, durability, and cost. Current PEMFC technology is based on expensive perflourinated proton-exchange membranes (PEMs) that operate effectively only under fully hydrated conditions. There is considerable application-driven interest in lowering the membrane cost and extending the operating window of PEMs. PEMFC system complexity could be reduced by the development of 'water-free' electrolytes that do not require hydration. It also enables the PEMFC to be operated under 'warm' conditions (i.e. above 100 °C) thus further improving its efficiency. Capital cost could also be further reduced because at warmer conditions less Pt could be used. This paper presents an overview of the key requirements for the proton exchange membranes (PEM) used in fuel cell applications, along with a description of the membrane materials currently being used and their ability to meet these requirements. A number of possible alternative candidates are reviewed and presented in this paper. Also discussed are some of the new materials, technologies, and research directions being pursued to try to meet the demanding performance and durability needs of the PEM fuel cell industry. The alternative PEMs are classified into three categories: (1) modified Nafion{\textregistered} composite membranes; (2) functionalized non-fluorinated membranes and composite membranes therein; and (3) acid-base composite membranes. Several commonly used inorganic additives are reviewed in the context of composite membranes. Finally, the general methods of the measuring and evaluating of proton exchange membrane properties have been investigated such as proton conductivity, ion exchange capacity, water uptake, gas permeability, methanol permeability, durability, thermal stability and fuel cell performance test. {\textcopyright} 2009 Professor T.

abstract = {Complex dielectric spectra of associating liquids are presented and are discussed considering their relaxation properties. Particular emphasis is given to water and aqueous solutions and to alcohols and mixtures of alcohols with dipolar and non-polar solvents. The relaxation properties of the associating systems are examined in the light of a wait-and-switch model of dielectric relaxation in which the relaxation time is governed by the period for which a given ensemble of hydrogen bond partners within the hydrogen network has to wait until favorable conditions for a reorientation of a molecular permanent dipole exist. These conditions are provided by an additional molecule or group which firstly tends to lower the potential energy barrier for reorientation and which secondly, at the same time, offers a site for the formation of a new hydrogen bond. Some experimental findings are discussed in terms of the wait-and-switch model, among them the reduced dielectric relaxation time of water under hydrostatic pressure, effects of negative and hydrophobic hydration of ions, and the influence that water, on the one hand, and n-alkanes, on the other hand, act on the relaxation of alcohols.},

abstract = {Structural memory of aqueous systems, such as neat water and biomolecules, in an aqueous environment is strongly influenced by hydrogen bond dynamics. Vibrational spectroscopy in the femtosecond (fs) time domain is applied to map structural dynamics in real-time and identify underlying molecular interactions. Neat liquid water displays an ultrafast loss of structural memory with the fastest decay of structural correlations occurring in the sub-100 fs regime. Both OH stretching and bending excitations of water molecules decay on a subpicosecond time scale, followed by dissipation of excess energy in the hydrogen bond network within a few picoseconds. Water shells around fully hydrated DNA show similar although slightly slower dynamics. A detailed study of hydration shells around ionic phosphate groups in the DNA backbone demonstrates a strong phosphate-water coupling and a subpicosecond rearrangement of hydrogen bonds upon energy disposal. Hydration shells serve as primary heat sinks for excess energy. {\textcopyright} 2009 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin New York.},

abstract = {Transport phenomena in water, such as ionic conduction and viscous flow, can be treated as rate processes and activation energies calculated by the method of Arrhenius. These activation energies are highly dependent on structural changes in liquid water. The rate-determining step for the mechanism of electrical conduction of aqueous solutions of strong 1:1 electrolytes is “hole” formation in the solvent. The process occurs in both the “free” monomeric water and in the rarified Frank-Wen clusters. The activation energy of this process exhibits a maximum at about 4°C and a minimum at about 2000 bars. Protons conduct largely by the Grotthuss mechanism in aqueous solution. At 1 atm the rate-determining step for this process is the rotation of H 2O, or of H 3O +, but this step is so facilitated by increasing pressure and thereby breaking-up the water structure that by about 1,500 bars the proton flip, possibly by quantum-mechanical tunnelling, becomes limiting. At 1 atm the Grotthuss mechanism is confined to the “free,” rotatable, water monomers. The activation energy of the process decreases with increasing pressure or increasing temperature. The activation energy of the viscous flow of water does not exhibit a maximum at 4°C; thus the mechanism of this process is probably some kind of rotational tumbling of the clusters through the “free” water rather than “hole” formation in the solvent. Highly hydrated species such as MgSO 4, too large to fit into the “holes,” may conduct by a similar mechanism. Studies of the Fe(II)Fe(III) electron exchange in mixed solvents and in ice have shown that electrons, like protons, can be transferred over great distances in water by the Grotthuss mechanism. The above transport processes play important roles in biological systems.

Diese Aktivierungsenergien h{\"{a}}ngen sehr stark von strukturellen{\"{A}}nderungen im fl{\"{u}}ssigen Wasser ab. Der geschwindigkeitsbestimmende Schritt im Vorgang der elektrischen Leitung bei w{\"{a}}ssrigen L{\"{o}}sungen von starken 1:1 Elektrolyten ist die “Lochbildung” im L{\"{o}}sungsmittel. Der Vorgang findet sowohl im “freien”, monomeren Wasser als auch in den Frank-Wen'schen Bezirken statt. Die Aktivierungsenergie dieses Vorganges ist maximal bei ungef{\"{a}}hr 4°C und minimal bei ungef{\"{a}}hr 2000 Bar. Die Protonenleitung in w{\"{a}}ssrigen L{\"{o}}sungen findet weitgehend nach dem Grotthuss'schen Mechanismus statt. Bei 1 Atm. Druck ist der geschwindigkeitsbestimmende Schritt dieses Vorganges die Rotation des H 2O oder des H 3O +, jedoch wird letztere durch Druckanwendung infolge Aufbrechen der Wasserstruktur derart erleichtert, dass bei ungef{\"{a}}hr 1500 Bar der Protonensprung m{\"{o}}glicherweise durch quantenmechanisches Tunneling begrenzend wird. Bei 1 Atm. ist der Grotthuss'sche Mechanismus beschr{\"{a}}nkt auf die “freien”, beweglichen, monomeren Wassermolek{\"{u}}le. Die Aktivierungsenergie des Vorganges nimmt mit zunehmendem Druck oder zunehmender Temperatur ab. Die Aktivierungsenergie des viskosen Fliessens von Wasser weist bei 4°C kein Maximum auf; der Mechanismus dieses Vorganges ist deshalb wahrscheinlich eine Art von Drehtaumeln der Agregate durch das “freie” Wasser eher als eine ‘Lochbildung' im L{\"{o}}sungsmittel.

abstract = {The solubilities of polyethers are surprisingly counter-intuitive. The best-known example is the difference between polyethylene glycol ([–CH2–CH2–O–]n) which is infinitely soluble, and polyoxymethylene ([–CH2–O–]n) which is completely insoluble in water, exactly the opposite of what one expects from the C/O ratios of these molecules. Similar anomalies exist for oligomeric and cyclic polyethers. To solve this apparent mystery, we use femtosecond vibrational and GHz dielectric spectroscopy with complementary ab initio calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. We find that the dynamics of water molecules solvating polyethers is fundamentally different depending on their C/O composition. The ab initio calculations and simulations show that this is not because of steric effects (as is commonly believed), but because the partial charge on the O atoms depends on the number of C atoms by which they are separated. Our results thus show that inductive effects can have a major impact on aqueous solubilities. Polyethers are ubiquitous in our daily lives, and display counterintuitive solubilities in water. Here the authors show, by ultrafast spectroscopies and computations, that solubility does not depend on steric factors but on the interaction of water molecules with the polymer's charge distribution},

abstract = {We present a library of Gaussian basis sets that has been specifically optimized to perform accurate molecular calculations based on density functional theory. It targets a wide range of chemical environments, including the gas phase, interfaces, and the condensed phase. These generally contracted basis sets, which include diffuse primitives, are obtained minimizing a linear combination of the total energy and the condition number of the overlap matrix for a set of molecules with respect to the exponents and contraction coefficients of the full basis. Typically, for a given accuracy in the total energy, significantly fewer basis functions are needed in this scheme than in the usual split valence scheme, leading to a speedup for systems where the computational cost is dominated by diagonalization. More importantly, binding energies of hydrogen bonded complexes are of similar quality as the ones obtained with augmented basis sets, i.e., have a small (down to 0.2 kcalmol) basis set superposition error, and the monomers have dipoles within 0.1 D of the basis set limit. However, contrary to typical augmented basis sets, there are no near linear dependencies in the basis, so that the overlap matrix is always well conditioned, also, in the condensed phase. The basis can therefore be used in first principles molecular dynamics simulations and is well suited for linear scaling calculations. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Institute of Physics.},

We observe a speed-up of the vibrational relaxation of the O-D stretching vibration of HDO molecules outside the first hydration shell of OH- from 1.7 ± 0.2ps for neat water to 1.0 ± 0.2ps for a solution of 5M NaOH in HDO:H2O. For the O-H vibration of HDO molecules outside the first hydration shell of OD-, we observe a similar speed-up from 750 ± 50fs to 600 ± 50fs for a solution of 6M NaOD in HDO:D2O. The acceleration of the decay is assigned to fluctuations in the energy levels of the HDO molecules due to charge transfer events and charge fluctuations. The reorientation dynamics of water molecules outside the first hydration shell are observed to show the same time constant of 2.5 ± 0.2ps as in bulk liquid water, indicating that there is no long range effect of the hydroxide ion on the hydrogen-bond structure of liquid water. The terahertz dielectric relaxation experiments show that the transfer of the hydroxide ion through liquid water involves the simultaneous motion of ∼7 surrounding water molecules, considerably less than previously reported for the proton. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Protons in acidic solution constantly hop from one water molecule to the next. In between the hopping, controversy lingers over the extent to which the proton either sticks largely to one water molecule in an Eigen motif or bridges two of them in a Zundel motif. It has been hard to probe this question directly because the distinguishing vibrational bands in bulk aqueous acid spectra are so broad. Wolke et al. studied deuterated prototypical Eigen clusters, D+(D2O)4, bound to an increasingly basic series of hydrogen bond acceptors (see the Perspective by Xantheas). These clusters displayed sharp bands in their vibrational spectra, highlighting a steadily evolving distortion toward a Zundel-like motif and pointing the way toward further investigations.Science, this issue p. 1131; see also p. 1101The Grotthuss mechanism explains the anomalously high proton mobility in water as a sequence of proton transfers along a hydrogen-bonded (H-bonded) network. However, the vibrational spectroscopic signatures of this process are masked by the diffuse nature of the key bands in bulk water. Here we report how the much simpler vibrational spectra of cold, composition-selected heavy water clusters, D+(D2O)n, can be exploited to capture clear markers that encode the collective reaction coordinate along the proton-transfer event. By complexing the solvated hydronium {\{}$\backslash$textquotedblleft{\}}Eigen{\{}$\backslash$textquotedblright{\}} cluster [D3O+(D2O)3] with increasingly strong H-bond acceptor molecules (D2, N2, CO, and D2O), we are able to track the frequency of every O-D stretch vibration in the complex as the transferring hydron is incrementally pulled from the central hydronium to a neighboring water molecule.},

abstract = {Alkaline anion exchange membrane (AAEM) fuel cell has attracted increasing attention in recent years due to its several outstanding advantages over proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell such as fast electrochemical kinetics and friendly alkaline environment for catalysts. In this study, a three-dimensional (3D) half-cell transient model is developed to study the dynamic characteristics of AAEM fuel cell under different step changes of operating conditions. It is found that the current density has significant effects on the distribution of liquid water, while the anode stoichiometric ratio effect is insignificant. More time is needed to reach a steady state when the current density decreases rather than increases, and the similar phenomenon also occurs when the operating temperature decreases rather than increases, however, this effect within a low temperature range becomes insignificant. Moreover, the overshoot and undershoot of water diffusion through membrane can also be observed with the step change of the anode stoichiometric ratio and anode inlet relative humidity. The model prediction also has reasonable agreement with published experimental data. The dynamic behaviors observed in this study are of significant importance to the development of AAEM fuel cells for portable and automotive applications.},

abstract = {The vibrational energy relaxation and transfer processes of the OH stretching and HOH bending vibrations in liquid water are investigated via the theoretical calculation of the pump-probe spectra obtained from nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations with the TTM3-F interaction potential. The excitation of the OH stretch induces an instantaneous response of the high frequency librational motions in the 600-1000 cm(-1) range. In addition, the excess energy of the OH stretch of a water molecule quickly transfers to the OH stretches of molecules in its first hydration shell with a time constant of ∼50 fs, followed by relaxation to the HOH bends of the surrounding molecules with a time constant of 230 fs. The excitation of the HOH bend also results in the ultrafast excitation of the high frequency librational motions. The energy of the excited HOH bend of a water molecule decays, with a time constant of 200 fs, mainly to the relaxation of the HOH bends of its surrounding molecules. The energies of the HOH bends were found to transfer quickly to the intermolecular motions via the coupling with the high frequency librational motions. The excess energy of the OH stretch or the HOH bend relaxes to the high frequency intermolecular librational motions and eventually to the hot ground state with a time scale of ∼1 ps via the coupling with the librational and translational motions. The energy relaxation and transfer processes were found to depend on the local hydrogen bonding network; the relaxations of the excess energy of the OH stretch and the HOH bend of four- and five-coordinated molecules are faster than those of a three-coordinated molecule due to the delocalization of the vibrational motions of the former (four- and five-coordinated molecules) compared to those of the later (three-coordinated molecules). The present results highlight the importance of the high frequency intermolecular librational modes in facilitating the ultrafast energy relaxation process in liquid water via their strong nonlinear couplings with the intramolecular OH stretching and HOH bending vibrations.},

abstract = {Water and ion dynamics in concentrated LiCl solutions were studied using ultrafast 2D IR spectroscopy with the methyl thiocyanate (MeSCN) CN stretch as the vibrational probe. The IR absorption spectrum of MeSCN has two peaks, one peak for water associated with the nitrogen lone pair of MeSCN (W) and the other peak corresponding to Li+ associated with the lone pair (L). To extract the spectral diffusion (structural dynamics) of W and L species, we developed a method that isolates the peak of interest by subtracting the 2D Gaussian proxies of multiple interfering peaks. Center line slope data (normalized frequency–frequency correlation function) for 2D bands from the W and L are fit with triexponential functions. The fastest component (1.1–1.6 ps) is assigned to local hydrogen bond length fluctuations. The intermediate timescale (∼4.0 ps) corresponds to the hydrogen bond network rearrangement. The slowest component decays in ∼40 ps and corresponds to ion pair and ion cluster dynamics. The very similar W and...},

Vector network analyzer (VNA) operating in the frequency range 0.3 MHz to 3.0 GHz was used to obtain complex permittivity spectra. Complex permittivity of the liquid samples at two spot frequencies 9.1 GHz and 19.61 GHz were also measured using standard microwave benches. Dielectric constant at optical frequency (∈∞) was measured using Abbe's refractometer. Measured values of the dielectric loss (∈″) have been plotted against dielectric constant (∈′) in a complex plane for 1-propanol, benzonitrile and their mixtures. Various dielectric relaxation parameters like relaxation time ($\tau$), static dielectric constant (∈0) and high frequency limiting values of dielectric constant (∈∞1) were obtained from these curves. Dielectric relaxation parameters thus obtained were used to evaluate excess inverse relaxation time (1/$\tau$)E, excess static permittivity (∈0E), Kirkwood correlation factor (g), angular correlation factor (geff) and thermodynamic parameters. Molecular interaction between the molecular species of the liquid mixtures was interpreted in terms of these parameters. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Although the extra galactic magnetic fields is extremely weak at present time (about 10 -9 Gauss), the primordial magnetic field at the electroweak scale could be strong (of order 1017 Gauss). Therefore, at this scale, the effects of the spin flavor precession could not be negligible. Using present limit on neutrino magnetic moments, we show that the lepton asymmetry may be reduced by 50{\%} due to the spin flavor precession induced by strong primordial magnetic fields. In addition, the leptogenesis will have different feature from the standard scenario of leptogenesis, where the lepton asymmetry continues to oscillate even after the electroweak phase transition. {\textcopyright} Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Neutron diffraction data for water and ice in the form of OO, OH and HH partial structure factors now exist over a temperature range 220-673 K, and at pressures up to {\~{}}400 MPa. In order for these data to be useful for comparing with different computer simulations and theories of water, it is first necessary to Fourier transform them to the corresponding site-site radial distribution functions. The process of doing this is not straightforward because of the inherent systematic uncertainties in the data, which arise primarily in the case of neutron scattering, from the inelasticity or recoil effects that can distort the experimental data. In this paper, it is shown that the empirical potential structure refinement procedure, which attempts to fit a three-dimensional ensemble of water molecules to all three partial structure factors simultaneously, leads to improved reliability in the extracted radial distribution functions. There are still some uncertainties, primarily associated with the hardness of the repulsive core of the intermolecular potential, which current data are not precise enough to resolve. The derived empirical potentials show some variability associated with particular experiments. General trends can be discerned however which indicate polarisation effects may be significant when effective intermolecular potentials are used over a wide temperature and density range.

All spectra could be represented by a single Cole-Cole relaxation time distribution attributed to the cooperative relaxation of the solvent. The concentration dependence of the effective hydration number of OH- has been determined. For aluminate and borate solutions the deduced parameters: effective conductivity Ke, static permittivity $\epsilon$, relaxation time $\tau$, and distribution parameter a suggest a 1:1 replacement of hydroxide by aluminate and borate, accompanied by a release of bound water. The lack of an ion-pair relaxation process despite notable ion association suggests that rapid proton exchange is important not only for the dynamics of OH- but also for Al(OH)4- and B(OH)4-. {\textcopyright} 1999 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Ultrafast nonlinear vibrational spectroscopy with mid-IR pumping and incoherent anti-Stokes Raman probing is used to study $\nu$=1 excitations of OH stretching (VOH) of water and of HOD in D 2O solvent (HOD/D 2O). The parent VOH decay and the appearance of daughter stretching and bending excitations are simultaneously monitored, which allows for characterization of the stretch decay pathways. At all times and with all pump frequencies within the $\nu$ OH band, the excited-state spectrum can be fit by two overlapping subbands, a broader red-shifted band $\nu$ OHR and a narrower blue-shifted band $\nu$ OHB. We show these subbands are dynamically distinguishable. They decay with different lifetimes and evidence characteristically different decay pathways. Excitations of the $\nu$ OHR subband generate bending vibrations that $\nu$ OHB does not. The shorter lifetime (0.5 ps) of the $\nu$ OHR subband compared to the $\nu$ OHB subband (0.8-0.9 ps) results primarily from enhanced stretch-to-bend anharmonic coupling. The subbands represent persistent structures in the excited state, in that interconversion between subbands (2-10 ps) is slower than excited-state decay. A tentative structural interpretation is proposed. The $\nu$ OHR subband, on the basis of simulations, its red shift, and its shorter lifetime, is proposed to result from strongly hydrogen-bonded "ice-like" water. The $\nu$ OHR subband has a smaller amplitude in HOD/D 2O than in water, possibly because HOD has a single localized OH-stretching vibration whereas water has two delocalized stretching vibrations.},

The OD hydroxyl stretch of dilute HOD in H(2)O in concentrated (5.5 M) aqueous solutions of sodium tetrafluoroborate (NaBF(4)) displays a spectrum with a broad water-like band (hydroxyl bound to water oxygen) and a resolved, blue shifted band (hydroxyl bound to BF(4)(-)). At short time (200 fs), the 2D IR vibrational echo spectrum has 4 peaks, 2 on the diagonal and 2 off-diagonal. The 2 diagonal peaks are the 0-1 transitions of the water-like band and the hydroxyl-anion band. Vibrational echo emissions at the 1-2 transition frequencies give rise to 2 off-diagonal peaks. On a picosecond time scale, additional off-diagonal peaks grow in. These new peaks arise from chemical exchange between water hydroxyls bound to anions and hydroxyls bound to water oxygens. The growth of the chemical exchange peaks yields the time dependence of anion-water hydroxyl hydrogen bond switching under thermal equilibrium conditions as T(aw) = 7 +/- 1 ps. Pump-probe measurements of the orientational relaxation rates and vibrational lifetimes are used in the CES data analysis. The pump-probe measurements are shown to have the correct functional form for a system undergoing exchange.},

We show that when a dissolved salt consists of a strongly hydrated ion with a weakly hydrated counterion the reorientation of water molecules around the strongly hydrated ion is anisotropic, in the sense that differently charged ions affect reorientation along different molecular axes: cations mainly slow the reorientation dynamics of the water dipole vectors, and anions mainly slow down the reorientation dynamics of the hydroxyl group that points toward the anion. In both cases, motion along only one molecular axis is impeded, so that the hydration shell is best described as semirigid. In this semirigid hydration picture, water molecules in the first hydr...},

Using this compilation we have developed a dynamic interpolation scheme which gives the "best" value for the permittivity of water, at a given frequency and temperature, together with an estimate of the uncertainty in the calculated value. As new experimental measurements are introduced into the data base the interpolation scheme is automatically refined. The second step depends upon the collaboration of our readers. We welcome constructive criticism, new permittivity data etc. It is only by such a co-operation that experimental measurements and uncertainties can be evaluated and an international standard established.

abstract = {The level of complexity with which any biological ion interaction mechanism can be investigated, whether it is a binding mechanism in proteins or a permeation mechanism in ion channels, is invariably limited by the state-of-the-art of our understanding of the characteristic properties of ion solvation. Currently, our understanding of the energetic properties of ion solvation in aqueous phase is considered adequate enough to have helped us obtain satisfactory descriptions of the role of energetics in several biological ion interaction processes. In contrast, the lack of consensus among all the experimental structural hydration data determined more than 10??years ago, particularly regarding ion hydration numbers, has limited us to nothing better than speculation regarding the roles of local spatial environments in these mechanisms. Here we revisit experimental and theoretical work applied to probe hydration numbers of three alkali metal ions, Li+, Na+ and K+, and analyze them to clarify the current state-of-the-art of our understanding of their structural hydration properties. We find that with substantial improvements over the past 10??years in areas of experimental techniques, data analysis strategies, and theoretical and computational approaches for interrogating ion hydration structures, there is now growing consensus regarding the hydration numbers of these ions. We see that under physiological conditions, ab initio methods suggest that all three ions prefer strong coordination with exactly 4 water molecules, a result we find consistent with some older experimental measurements. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations invariably identify additional "loosely" coordinated water molecules at the far slopes of the principle maxima of the radial distribution profiles for Na+ and K+ ions. We suggest that these statistical admixtures of additional oxygen atoms have resulted in the most recent experimentally determined hydration numbers of Na+ ions to be 5 and K+ ions to be 6. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The rapidly growing eld of ab initio molecular dynamics is reviewed in the spirit of a series of lectures given at the Winterschool 2000 at the John von Neumann Institute for Computing, J ulich. Several such molecular dynamics schemes are compared which arise from following various approximations to the fully coupled Schr odinger equation for electrons and nuclei. Special focus is given to the Car Parrinello method with discussion of both strengths and weaknesses in addition to its range of applicability. To shed light upon why the CarParrinello approach works several alternate perspectives of the underlying ideas are presented. The implementation of ab initio molecular dynamics within the framework of plane wavepseudopotential density functional theory is given in detail, including diagonalization and minimization techniques as required for the BornOppenheimer variant. E cient algorithms for the most important computational kernel routines are presented. The adaptation of these routines to distributed memory parallel computers is discussed using the implementation within the computer code CPMD as an example. Several advanced techniques from the eld of molecular dynamics, (constant temperature dynamics, constant pressure dynamics) and electronic structure theory (free energy functional, excited states) are introduced. The combination of the path integral method with ab initio molecular dynamics is presented in detail, showing its limitations and possible extensions. Finally, a wide range of applications from materials science to biochemistry is listed, which shows the enormous potential of ab initio molecular dynamics for both explaining and predicting properties of molecules and materials on an atomic scale.},

@article{Kreuer2001,
abstract = {The transport properties and the swelling behaviour of NAFION and different sulfonated polyetherketones are explained in terms of distinct differences on the microstructures and in the pKa of the acidic functional groups. The less pronounced hydrophobic/hydrophilic separation of sulfonated polyetherketones compared to NAFION corresponds to narrower, less connected hydrophilic channels and to larger separations between less acidic sulfonic acid functional groups. At high water contents, this is shown to significantly reduce electroosmotic drag and water permeation whilst maintaining high proton conductivity. Blending of sulfonated polyetherketones with other polyaryls even further reduces the solvent permeation (a factor of 20 compared to NAFION), increases the membrane flexibility in the dry state and leads to an improved swelling behaviour. Therefore, polymers based on sulfonated polyetherketones are not only interesting low-cost alternative membrane material for hydrogen fuel cell applications, they may also help to reduce the problems associated with high water drag and high methanol cross-over in direct liquid methanol fuel cells (DMFC). The relatively high conductivities observed for oligomers containing imidazole as functional groups may be exploited in fully polymeric proton conducting systems with no volatile proton solvent operating at temperatures significantly beyond 100°C, where methanol vapour may be used as a fuel in DMFCs.},

@article{Zheng2004,
abstract = {In this paper we propose and discuss the laser-induced circular dichroism (LICD) effect, which is expected to occur in linear molecules pumped by a strong circular resonant light beam. The effect is to be detected via the absorption of a weak circularly polarized probe beam on another transition. Analogous to the external magnetic field in magnetic circular dichroism the resonant circular polarized pumping optical field can induce the nonzero antisymmetric rotational polarizabilities of a linear molecule, and cause the LICD effect. LICD contains three distinct contributions from M-dependent splittings of the sublevels mid R:JM due to the ac Stark effect, from the differences of Boltzmann statistical distributions among the ground state sublevels mid R:JM due to the ac Stark splittings, and from the changes of occupation probability in rotational sublevels mid R:JM due to the pumping effect. The fundamental formulas for the above three terms of LICD have been deduced by the density matrix method. As an example, the LICD for CO molecules have been calculated. The results indicate that in comparison with the rotationally resolved magnetic vibrational circular dichroism experiment, LICD may be measurable and form a basis of a different kind of CD spectroscopy.},

@article{Liu2015,
abstract = {We study the energy relaxation and structural relaxation dynamics of hydrated protons in Nafion membranes at different hydration levels using femtosecond infrared transient absorption spectroscopy. At low hydration levels we observe that the excitation of the proton vibration of an Eigen-like proton hydration structure leads to a structural relaxation process in which the Eigen-like structure evolves to a Zundel-like proton hydration structure. This reorganization leads to a transfer of the proton charge and closely follows the mechanism of infrared-induced adiabatic proton transfer that has been proposed by S. Hammes-Schiffer, J. T. Hynes, and others. At high hydration levels, the spectral dynamics are dominated by vibrational energy relaxation and subsequent cooling of the proton hydration structures and the surrounding water molecules. Using a kinetic analysis of the transient spectral data, we determine the rates of proton transfer, vibrational energy relaxation, and cooling as a function of hydration level. We find that infrared-induced proton transfer occurs at all hydration levels but becomes less observable at high hydration levels due to the increasingly dominant influence of the vibrational energy relaxation.},

As we show, studying reactions in a stepwise manner in ultracold helium nanodroplets by mass-selective infrared (IR) spectroscopy provides an avenue to mimic these “stardust conditions”in the laboratory. In our joint experimental/ theoretical study, in which we successively add H2O molecules to HCl, we disclose a unique IR fingerprint at 1337 cm−1 that heralds hydronium (H3O+) formation and, thus, acid dissociation generating solvated protons. In stark contrast, no reaction is observed when reversing the sequence by allowing HCl to interact with preformed small embryonic ice-like clusters. Our ab initio simulations demonstrate that not only reaction stoichiometry but also the reaction sequence needs to be explicitly considered to rationalize ultracold chemistry.},

The ethynyl linkers are strong IR markers that we use in time-resolved vibrational spectroscopic studies to get insight into the character and dynamics of the electronically excited states of these compounds on the picosecond to nanosecond time scale. In combination with electronic transient absorption studies and DFT calculations, our studies show that the conjugation of the non-C3-symmetric triethynyl terthiophene system in the excited state strongly affects one of the thiophene rings involved in the ring closure. As a result, cyclization of the otherwise photochromic 3,3″-dimethyl-2,2′:3′,2″-terthiophene core is inhibited. Instead, the photoexcited compounds undergo intersystem crossing to a long-lived triplet excited state from which they convert back to the ground state.},

In this paper a series expansion of the alignment of a polar molecule in a non-polar solvent is presented for a rigid-lattice model, first introduced by Van Vleck for the dielectric constant of a very dilute solution. Different results up to second order in the dipolar interaction are obtained for a simple, a body centred, or a face centred cubic lattice and a lattice whose lattice points are uniformly distributed in a continuum. The latter formula is compared with that calculated on the basis of the Lorentz local field model and with that of Buckingham in which the inter- action between the dipoles themselves is neglected. 1.},

abstract = {The interaction between a polarizable particle and a reflecting wall is examined. A macroscopic approach is adopted in which the averaged force is computed from the Maxwell stress tensor. The particular case of a perfectly reflecting wall and a sphere with a dielectric function given by the Drude model is examined in detail. It is found that the force can be expressed as the sum of a monotonically decaying function of position and of an oscillatory piece. At large separations, the oscillatory piece is the dominant contribution and is much larger than the Casimir-Polder interaction that arises in the limit that the sphere is a perfect conductor. It is argued that this enhancement of the force can be interpreted in terms of the frequency spectrum of vacuum fluctuations. In the limit of a perfectly conducting sphere, there are cancellations between different parts of the spectrum that no longer occur as completely in the case of a sphere with frequency-dependent polarizability. Estimates of the magnitude of the oscillatory component of the force suggest that it may be large enough to be observable.},

abstract = {The prediction and experimental confirmation of a previously unsuspected kinetic effect occurring in electrolyte solutions are presented herein. Kinetic polarization deficiency may be described as a reduction, with respect to the pure solvent, in the static permittivity of the solution; the decrement in epsilon0 is shown to be proportional to the product of the dielectric relaxation time of the solvent and the low frequency conductivity of the solution. The kinetic ion-solvent interaction affects the capacitive admittance in two closely related ways: as an ion migrates, the surrounding volume elements of the liquid tend to rotate according to the laws of hydrodynamics, and although dielectric relaxation tends to restore an equilibrium polarization appropriate to the local electric field, this adjustment is not instantaneous; rather it lags behind by the dielectric relaxation time. Conversely, the force that an external field exerts on an ion does not develop its full strength instantly because the ion is driven partly by the external field and partly by the polarization that develops in response to the applied field, the polarization field evolving with a time constant that is the relaxation time for the orientation of solvent dipoles.},

While the addition of NaCl leads to large spectral changes, the effect of HCl on the observed X-ray absorption spectrum is surprisingly small. Density functional theory calculations suggest that this difference primarily reflects a strong blue shift of the hydrated proton (in either the Eigen (H9O4+) or Zundel (H2O5+) forms) spectrum relative to that of H2O, indicating the tighter binding of electrons in H3O+. This spectral shift counteracts the spectral changes that arise from direct electrostatic perturbation of water molecules in the first solvation shell of Cl-. Consequently, the observed spectral changes effected by HCl addition are minimal compared to those engendered by NaCl. Additionally, these results indicate that the effect of monovalent cations on the nature of the unoccupied orbitals of water molecules in the first solvation shell is negligible, in contrast to the large effects of monovalent anions.},

abstract = {The structural properties of the influenza A virus M2 transmembrane channel in dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine bilayer for each of the four protonation states of the proton-gating His-37 tetrad and their effects on proton transport for this low-pH activated, highly proton-selective channel are studied by classical molecular dynamics with the multistate empirical valence-bond (MS-EVB) methodology. The excess proton permeation free energy profile and maximum ion conductance calculated from the MS-EVB simulation data combined with the Poisson-Nernst-Planck theory indicates that the triply protonated His-37 state is the most likely open state via a significant side-chain conformational change of the His-37 tetrad. This proposed open state of M2 has a calculated proton permeation free energy barrier of 7 kcal/mol and a maximum conductance of 53 pS compared to the experimental value of 6 pS. By contrast, the maximum conductance for Na(+) is calculated to be four orders of magnitude lower, in reasonable agreement with the experimentally observed proton selectivity. The pH value to activate the channel opening is estimated to be 5.5 from dielectric continuum theory, which is also consistent with experimental results. This study further reveals that the Ala-29 residue region is the primary binding site for the antiflu drug amantadine (AMT), probably because that domain is relatively spacious and hydrophobic. The presence of AMT is calculated to reduce the proton conductance by 99.8{\%} due to a significant dehydration penalty of the excess proton in the vicinity of the channel-bound AMT.},

@article{Horne1966,
abstract = {Transport phenomena in water, such as ionic conduction and viscous flow, can be treated as rate processes and activation energies calculated by the method of Arrhenius. These activation energies are highly dependent on structural changes in liquid water. The rate-determining step for the mechanism of electrical conduction of aqueous solutions of strong 1:1 electrolytes is “hole” formation in the solvent. The process occurs in both the “free” monomeric water and in the rarified Frank-Wen clusters. The activation energy of this process exhibits a maximum at about 4°C and a minimum at about 2000 bars. Protons conduct largely by the Grotthuss mechanism in aqueous solution. At 1 atm the rate-determining step for this process is the rotation of H 2O, or of H 3O +, but this step is so facilitated by increasing pressure and thereby breaking-up the water structure that by about 1,500 bars the proton flip, possibly by quantum-mechanical tunnelling, becomes limiting. At 1 atm the Grotthuss mechanism is confined to the “free,” rotatable, water monomers. The activation energy of the process decreases with increasing pressure or increasing temperature. The activation energy of the viscous flow of water does not exhibit a maximum at 4°C; thus the mechanism of this process is probably some kind of rotational tumbling of the clusters through the “free” water rather than “hole” formation in the solvent. Highly hydrated species such as MgSO 4, too large to fit into the “holes,” may conduct by a similar mechanism. Studies of the Fe(II)Fe(III) electron exchange in mixed solvents and in ice have shown that electrons, like protons, can be transferred over great distances in water by the Grotthuss mechanism. The above transport processes play important roles in biological systems. On peut traiter comme des vitesses de processus et calculer des{\'{e}}nergies d'activation selon Arrh{\'{e}}nius certains ph{\'{e}}nom{\`{e}}nes de transport dans l'eau tels que la conduction conique et l'{\'{e}}coulement visqueux. Ces{\'{e}}nergies d'activation d{\'{e}}pendent largement de changements structuraux de l'eau liquide. L'{\'{e}}tape r{\'{e}}gulatrice du m{\'{e}}canisme de conduction{\'{e}}lectrique dans des solutions aqueusu d'{\'{e}}lectrolytes forts 1:1 est la formation de “trous” dans le solvant, intervenant{\`{a}}la fois dans l'eau monom{\`{e}}re et dans les “essaims” (clusters) rar{\'{e}}fi{\'{e}}s de Frank-Wen. Une telle{\'{e}}nergie d'activation pr{\'{e}}sente un maximum vers 4°C et un minimum vers 2000 bars. Le m{\'{e}}canisme Grotthus de conduction protonique est notable en solution aqueuse. A 1 atm., l'{\'{e}}tape r{\'{e}}gulatrice est la rotation de H 2O ou de H 3O +, mais cette{\'{e}}tape est si facilit{\'{e}}e par l'{\'{e}}l{\'{e}}vation de pression, donc par la rupture de la structure de l'eau, qu'il est possible que le d{\'{e}}placement du proton par effet tunnel m{\'{e}}cano-quantique devienne r{\'{e}}gulateur vers 1500 bars.

Des esp{\`{e}}ces tr{\`{e}}s hydrat{\'{e}}es telles que MgSO 4, trop volumineuses pour occuper les “trous” conduisent probablement selon un m{\'{e}}canisme analogue.

Diese Aktivierungsenergien h{\"{a}}ngen sehr stark von strukturellen{\"{A}}nderungen im fl{\"{u}}ssigen Wasser ab. Der geschwindigkeitsbestimmende Schritt im Vorgang der elektrischen Leitung bei w{\"{a}}ssrigen L{\"{o}}sungen von starken 1:1 Elektrolyten ist die “Lochbildung” im L{\"{o}}sungsmittel. Der Vorgang findet sowohl im “freien”, monomeren Wasser als auch in den Frank-Wen'schen Bezirken statt. Die Aktivierungsenergie dieses Vorganges ist maximal bei ungef{\"{a}}hr 4°C und minimal bei ungef{\"{a}}hr 2000 Bar. Die Protonenleitung in w{\"{a}}ssrigen L{\"{o}}sungen findet weitgehend nach dem Grotthuss'schen Mechanismus statt. Bei 1 Atm. Druck ist der geschwindigkeitsbestimmende Schritt dieses Vorganges die Rotation des H 2O oder des H 3O +, jedoch wird letztere durch Druckanwendung infolge Aufbrechen der Wasserstruktur derart erleichtert, dass bei ungef{\"{a}}hr 1500 Bar der Protonensprung m{\"{o}}glicherweise durch quantenmechanisches Tunneling begrenzend wird. Bei 1 Atm. ist der Grotthuss'sche Mechanismus beschr{\"{a}}nkt auf die “freien”, beweglichen, monomeren Wassermolek{\"{u}}le. Die Aktivierungsenergie des Vorganges nimmt mit zunehmendem Druck oder zunehmender Temperatur ab. Die Aktivierungsenergie des viskosen Fliessens von Wasser weist bei 4°C kein Maximum auf; der Mechanismus dieses Vorganges ist deshalb wahrscheinlich eine Art von Drehtaumeln der Agregate durch das “freie” Wasser eher als eine ‘Lochbildung' im L{\"{o}}sungsmittel.

The hydrogen-bond dynamics of water molecules solvating a Cl-, Br-, or I- anion is slow compared with neat liquid water, indicating that the aqueous solvation shells of these ions are rigid. This rigidity can play an important role in the overall dynamics of chemical reactions in aqueous solution. The experiments were performed with femtosecond midinfrared nonlinear spectroscopy, because this technique allows the spectral response of the water molecules in the solvation shell to be distinguished clearly from that of the other water molecules in the solution.},

abstract = {This paper reports measurements of static microscopic dielectric response of several dipolar solvents to charge redistribution in a fluorescent probe. Contrary to recent predictions of dielectric theories and computer simulations of bulk liquids, the observed dielectric response of most solvents conforms to the macroscopic continuum description even at atomic distances, as if these solvents had no spatial intermolecular structure. Such conformance is observed for several probes when the contribution of specific probe-solvent interactions to the response is negligible. However, water, formamide, and glycerol exhibit anomalous responses even though such a probe is used. We discuss a possible reason for the macroscopic-like behavior and a connection between the anomaly and fluctuating structures formed by anomalous solvents near the hydrophobic surface of the probe.},

abstract = {The prediction and experimental confirmation of a previously unsuspected kinetic effect occurring in electrolyte solutions are presented herein. Kinetic polarization deficiency may be described as a reduction, with respect to the pure solvent, in the static permittivity of the solution; the decrement in epsilon0 is shown to be proportional to the product of the dielectric relaxation time of the solvent and the low frequency conductivity of the solution. The kinetic ion-solvent interaction affects the capacitive admittance in two closely related ways: as an ion migrates, the surrounding volume elements of the liquid tend to rotate according to the laws of hydrodynamics, and although dielectric relaxation tends to restore an equilibrium polarization appropriate to the local electric field, this adjustment is not instantaneous; rather it lags behind by the dielectric relaxation time. Conversely, the force that an external field exerts on an ion does not develop its full strength instantly because the ion is driven partly by the external field and partly by the polarization that develops in response to the applied field, the polarization field evolving with a time constant that is the relaxation time for the orientation of solvent dipoles.},

@article{Marx1998,
abstract = {Explanations for the anomalously high mobility of protons in liquid water began with Grotthuss's idea(1,2) of structural diffusion' nearly two centuries ago. Subsequent explanations have refined this concept by invoking thermal hopping(3,4), proton tunnelling(5,6) or solvation effects(7). More recently, two main structural models have emerged for the hydrated proton. Eigen(8,9) proposed the formation of an H9O4+ complex in which an H3O+ core is strongly hydrogen-bonded to three H2O molecules. Zundel(10,11), meanwhile, supported the notion of an H5O2+ complex in which the proton is shared between two H2O molecules. Here we use ab initio path integral(12-14) simulations to address this question, These simulations include time-independent equilibrium thermal and quantum fluctuations of all nuclei, and determine interatomic interactions from the electronic structure. We find that the hydrated proton forms a fluxional defect in the hydrogen-bonded network with both H9O4+ and H5O2+ occurring only in the sense of 'limiting' or 'ideal' structures. The defect can become delocalized over several hydrogen bonds owing to quantum fluctuations. Solvent polarization induces a small barrier to proton transfer, which is washed out by zero-point motion. The proton can consequently be considered part of a 'low-barrier hydrogen bond'(15,16), in which tunnelling is negligible and the simplest concepts of transition-state theory do not apply. The rate of proton diffusion is determined by thermally induced hydrogen-bond breaking in the second solvation shell.},

abstract = {Subpicosecond fluorescence anisotropy measurements are used to characterize the rotational dynamics of coumarin 153 (C153) in 35 common solvents and eight solvent mixtures at room temperature. The rotational anisotropy decays of C153 are generally nonexponential as a result of the non-Markovian nature of the friction on its rotational motion. Rotational correlation times are observed to be larger in polar solvents than in nonpolar solvents of the same viscosity. This difference is examined in the context of theories of dielectric friction, which relate the extra friction in polar solute/solvent systems to long-range dipoledipole interactions. Since the latter interactions have been thoroughly characterized via dynamic Stokes shift measurements for the same solute/solvent combinations studied here, the present data provide a unique opportunity to test general concepts of dielectric friction. Contrary to expectations, the departures from simple hydrodynamic behavior cannot be modeled using only theories of rotational dielectric friction. More important than dielectric friction is the role that the relative solute/solvent size plays in determining the extent of solutesolvent coupling. Once this size dependence is approximately accounted for, the remaining departures from simple hydrodynamic behavior are relatively small in all solvents. In polar aprotic solvents, solvation data indicate that dielectric friction effects should be rather modest (1020{\%} of the total friction). In these solvents no clear correlation is found between dielectric friction predictions and the observed solutesolvent coupling. However, in normal alcohol solvents the effects of dielectric friction are predicted to be large and well beyond the scatter in the experimental data. No evidence for such an important dielectric friction contribution is observed in these solvents, in spite of the fact that long-time components of the solvation dynamics do appear to be present in the rotational friction.},

The automated measurement procedure allows fast acquisition at closely spaced intervals over the entire measurement bandwidth: 60-90 GHz. The presented technique is an absolute method and as such is not prone to calibration errors. The technique is suited to investigate low-loss as well as high-loss liquids in contrast to similar setups described previously. We present measurements for a high-loss liquid (water), an intermediate-loss sample (ethanol), and for nearly loss-less n-octane. Due to the available phase information, the present data have an improved accuracy in comparison with literature data.},

abstract = {Dynamical solvation data recently obtained with the probe solute coumarin 153 are used to test the reliability of dielectric continuum models for estimating dielectric friction effects. In particular, the predictions of the Nee-Zwanzig theory of rotational dielectric friction are examined in some detail. The analysis undertaken here uncovers an error made in virtually all previous applications of the Nee-Zwanzig formalism. The error involves neglect of the solvent's electronic polarizability when calculating dielectric friction constants. In highly polar solvents the effect of this neglect is shown to be minor, so that the results of past studies should not be appreciably altered. However, in weakly polar and especially in nondipolar solvents, the proper inclusion of electronic polarizability terms is essential. The equivalence between the Nee-Zwanzig theory of dielectric friction and more general continuum treatments of polar solvation dynamics is also demonstrated. This equivalence enables the use of solvation data to test the reliability of the Nee-Zwanzig description of electrical interactions between a solute and solvent that form the core of this and related continuum theories of dielectric friction. Comparisons to experimental data show that, with the important exception of nondipolar solvents, such continuum treatments provide reasonably accurate (+/-40{\%}) predictors of time-dependent solvation and/or dielectric friction.},

abstract = {Absorption of terahertz (THz) radiation by aqueous solutions of large solutes reports on the polarization response of their hydration shells. This is because the dipolar relaxation of the solute is dynamically frozen at these frequencies, and most of the solute-induced absorption changes, apart from the expulsion of water, are caused by interfacial water. We propose a model expressing the dipolar response of solutions in terms of a single parameter, the interface dipole moment induced in the interfacial water by electromagnetic radiation. We apply this concept to experimental THz absorption of hydrated sugars, amino acids, and proteins. None of the solutes studied here follow the expectations of dielectric theories, which predict a negative projection of the interface dipole on the external electric field. We find that this prediction is not able to describe the available experimental data, which instead suggests a nearly zero interface dipole for sugars and a more diverse pattern for amino acids. Hydrophobic amino acids, similarly to sugars, give rise to near zero interface dipoles, while strongly hydrophilic ones are best described by a positive projection of the interface dipole on the external field. The sign of the interface dipole is connected to the slope of the absorption coefficient with the solute concentration. A positive slope, implying an increase in the solution polarity relative to water, mirrors results frequently reported for protein solutions. We therefore use molecular dynamics simulations of hydrated glucose and lambda repressor protein to calculate the interface dipole moments of these solutes and the concentration dependence of the THz absorption. The absorption at THz frequencies increases with increasing solute concentration in both cases, implying a higher polarity of the solution compared to bulk water. The structure of the hydration layer, extracted from simulations, is qualitatively similar in both cases, with spatial correlations between the protein and water dipoles extending 4-5 nm into the bulk. The theory makes a testable prediction of the inversion of the positive slope at THz frequencies to a negative slope at lower frequencies of tens to hundreds of GHz.},

abstract = {Relaxation of nonequilibrium polarization fields in dielectrics is usually theoretically treated solely in terms of the reorientational motion of the polar molecules. If, however, the translational diffusion of these molecules is also taken into account, dielectric relaxation is accelerated. This results in the lowering of the dielectric friction that retards the motion of an ion or dipole in a dielectric. This reduction in dielectric friction is here calculated for two models: a time-dependent dipole at the center of a sphere, and a moving charge on the axis of a cylinder, each immersed in a dielectric. A parameter measuring the relative importance of rotation and diffusion is identified, and a substantial lowering of the dielectric friction is implied in many situations. It is shown that the boundary conditions play a decisive role in the properties of the fields. Directions for a further development of the theory of polarization diffusion are indicated. ?? 1983.},

abstract = {In order to reduce computational effort and to allow for the use of periodic boundary conditions,electrostatic interactions in explicit solvent simulations of molecular systems do not obey Coulomb's law. Instead, a number of “effective potentials” have been proposed, including truncated Coulomb, shifted, switched, reaction-field corrected, or Ewald potentials. The present study compares the performance of these schemes in the context of ionic solvation. To this purpose, a generalized form of the Born continuum model for ion solvation is developed, where ion–solvent and solvent–solvent interactions are determined by these effective potentials instead of Coulomb's law. An integral equation is formulated for calculating the polarization around a spherical ion from which the solvation free energy can be extracted. Comparison of the polarizations and free energies calculated for specific effective potentials and the exact Born result permits an assessment of the accuracy of these different schemes. Additionally, the present formalism can be used to develop corrections to the ionic solvation free energies calculated by molecular simulations implementing such effective potentials. Finally, an arbitrary effective potential is optimized to reproduce the Born polarization.},

In this paper a series expansion of the alignment up to second order terms in the dipolar interaction is presented for a non-polar molecule replacing a single polar molecule in a rigid lattice of molecular dipoles. Assuming isotropic polarizabilities for all molecules Van Vleck earlier applied the lattice model in a theory of the dielectric constant of a dilute solution. In the present calculation the polarizabilities of the non-polar molecule and the dipoles are assumed to be anisotropic and isotropic, respectively. The anisotropy of the non-polar molecule is relevant, since the value of the alignment is zero for the isotropic case. Different results are obtained for cubic lattices and for a lattice whose lattice points are uniformly distributed. In absence of a rigid dipole moment of the solvent molecules the latter formula may be coml{\~{}}ared with that implicity deduced by Buckingham for the Kerr effect. In the limit of strong dipoles the orientation imposed by the rigid dipole moments appears to be the major contribution to the alignment of the non-polar molecule.},

Special focus is given to the Car Parrinello method with discussion of both strengths and weaknesses in addition to its range of applicability. To shed light upon why the CarParrinello approach works several alternate perspectives of the underlying ideas are presented. The implementation of ab initio molecular dynamics within the framework of plane wavepseudopotential density functional theory is given in detail, including diagonalization and minimization techniques as required for the BornOppenheimer variant. E cient algorithms for the most important computational kernel routines are presented. The adaptation of these routines to distributed memory parallel computers is discussed using the implementation within the computer code CPMD as an example. Several advanced techniques from the eld of molecular dynamics, (constant temperature dynamics, constant pressure dynamics) and electronic structure theory (free energy functional, excited states) are introduced. The combination of the path integral method with ab initio molecular dynamics is presented in detail, showing its limitations and possible extensions. Finally, a wide range of applications from materials science to biochemistry is listed, which shows the enormous potential of ab initio molecular dynamics for both explaining and predicting properties of molecules and materials on an atomic scale.},

For pure acid solutions, protons are known to have a strong structuring effect on water, leading to a pronounced decrease of the dielectric response. We observe that this structuring is reduced when protons are co-solvated with salts. This reduction is exclusively observed for combinations of protons with other ions; for all studied solutions of co-solvated salts the effect on the structural dynamics of water is observed to be purely additive, even up to high concentrations. We derive an empirical model that quantitatively describes the non-additive effect of co-solvated protons and cations.

A series expansion of the alignment for a system of isotropically polarizable dipoles is presented up to second-order terms in the dipolar interaction. The result for a continuum has been compared with those cal- culated on the basis of the Lorentz and Onsager model of the liquid.

In this wide range of solvent viscosities, from the glass transition to beyond the melting point, the mean relaxation times for the two techniques which monitor dipolar orientation are identical within our resolution. For two characteristic decay traces recorded on the time scales of 10 ns and 1 s we compare the observed Stokes-shift dynamics with various theoretical approaches. The decay pattern is reproduced by the dipolar dynamic-mean-spherical-approximation, whereas the absolute time scale of the solvation is mapped by the dielectric polarization itself. For the solvent under study we find almost perfect agreement between experiment and the dipolar dMSA theory if the time scale of the predicted curve is rescaled by a factor of (??{\{}lunate{\}}???/??{\{}lunate{\}}s)1 2. ?? 1994.},

abstract = {Measurements of the conductance of HCl in water, methanol, ethanol,n‐propanol, ethylene glycol, glycerol, 1:4 dioxane, acetone, formic, and acetic acids and the respective aqueous‐nonaqueous systems have been made as a function of concentration of water and HCl. The degree of anomalous protonconductance decreases with increasing n in C n H2n+1OH, and conductance minima occur in aqueous alcoholic HCl solutions of low H2O content. Former theories of protonconductance have permitted no quantitative distinction to be made between the rates of classical proton transfer, quantum‐mechanical tunneling transfer, and water rotation as rate determining stages. If resonance in H3O{\textperiodcentered} is set up sufficiently quickly after arrival of a given proton at a water molecule, rotation of H3O{\textperiodcentered} cannot be a rate determining step. Detailed calculations of the rates of classical proton transfer, tunnel transfer, and the rate of rotation of water are made. Classical transfer is much slower and tunnel transfer much faster than corresponds to the observed protonmobility; rotation of hydrogen bonded water molecules near the H3O{\textperiodcentered} ion is the rate determining reaction (preceded and succeeded by fast tunneling of protons). This conclusion is quantitatively consistent with the OH′ mobility in water, and the H{\textperiodcentered}/D{\textperiodcentered}mobility ratio and qualitatively consistent with pressure and temperature effects and with the absence of abnormal mobility of NH4 {\textperiodcentered} and NH2′ in liquid NH3. A detailed interpretation of the dependence of abnormal conductance upon chain length in ROH gives fair quantitative agreement with experiment. The conductance minima observed in aqueous alcoholic HCl are quasi‐quantitatively predicted by the theory. The proton spends about 1{\%} of its time undergoing tunnel transfers; the effective existence of the H3O{\textperiodcentered} ion is thus confirmed.},

The dielectric part of the spectra has been represented by the semiempirical Cole-Cole relaxation spectral function to yield the extrapolated low-frequency (static) permittivity and the principal relaxation time of the solutions. At c {\textgreater} 0.2 mol/L the extrapolated permittivity follows the linear relation epsilon(0) = epsilon-w(0) (1 - 0.19 (L/mol) c) where epsilon-w(0) denotes the static permittivity of water at 20 °C. This dielectric decrement is related to the effects of dilution of the dipolar solvent, of kinetic depolarization, and of structure saturation. At lower NaCl concentration (c {\textless} 0.2 mol/L) small indications for an additional polarization mechanism are found. The principal dielectric relaxation time linearly decreases with the solute molality m. The relative molal shift in {\^{o}}s appears to be stronger at 20 °C (-(0.15 ( 0.06) (mol/kg)-1) than at higher temperatures (-(0.08 ( 0.03) (mol/kg)-1, 25 °C).

The expressions are obtained from the Kerr approximation together with diffusion models for the self part of the van Hove function and apply at all frequencies and wavelengths. Both spherical (scalar diffusion constants) and nonspherical (tensorial diffusion constants) diffusors are considered and the theory is applied to k‐dependent dielectric relaxation and ion solvation dynamics. The required equilibrium structure is obtained using the hypernetted chain (HNC) or reference hypernetted chain (RHNC) theories and Kerr/RHNC(HNC) results are given for fluids of dipolar hard spheres, dipolar hard ellipsoids, and water‐like particles. Comparisons are made with earlier work based upon coupling equilibrium theories, such as the mean spherical approximation (MSA) for dipolar hard spheres with a dynamical equation of the Smoluchowski–Vlasov (SV) type. It is shown that for spherical diffusors with the self part of the van Hove function treated at the Fick–Debye level, the SV and Kerr equations are in fact equivalent. However, even for spherical diffusors, the results obtained can differ substantially depending upon the equilibrium theory and/or the molecular model employed. For nonspherical diffusors, the anisotropy of the rotational diffusion tensor can also be an important parameter influencing the k‐dependent dielectric relaxation.},

@article{Kumar2000,
abstract = {Simulations of the time-dependent friction controlling rotational, translational, and vibrational motions of dipolar diatomic solutes in acetonitrile and methanol have been used to examine the nature of "dielectric" friction. The way in which electrical interactions increase the friction beyond that present in nonpolar systems is found to be rather different than what is anticipated by most theories of dielectric friction. Long-range electrostatic forces do not simply add an independent contribution to the friction due to short-ranged or "mechanical" sources (modeled here in terms of Lennard-Jones forces). Rather, the electrical and Lennard-Jones contributions are found to be strongly anticorrelated and not separable in any useful way. For some purposes, the mechanism by which electrical interactions increase friction is better viewed as a static electrostriction effect: electrical forces cause a subtle increase in atomic density in the solute's first solvation shell, which increases the amplitude of the force fluctuations derived from the Lennard-Jones interactions, i.e., the mechanical friction. However, electrical interactions also modify the dynamics of the friction, typically adding a long-time tail, which significantly increases the integral friction. Both of these effects must be included in a correct description of friction in the presence of polar interactions.},

abstract = {Relaxation of nonequilibrium polarization fields in dielectrics is usually theoretically treated solely in terms of the reorientational motion of the polar molecules. If, however, the translational diffusion of these molecules is also taken into account, dielectric relaxation is accelerated. This results in the lowering of the dielectric friction that retards the motion of an ion or dipole in a dielectric. This reduction in dielectric friction is here calculated for two models: a time-dependent dipole at the center of a sphere, and a moving charge on the axis of a cylinder, each immersed in a dielectric. A parameter measuring the relative importance of rotation and diffusion is identified, and a substantial lowering of the dielectric friction is implied in many situations. It is shown that the boundary conditions play a decisive role in the properties of the fields. Directions for a further development of the theory of polarization diffusion are indicated.},

abstract = {Simulations of a simplified model system are used to test analytical theories of dielectric friction and explore its connection to dipole solvation dynamics. The simulation model consists of a point dipole solute interacting with a finite collection of dipolar solvent molecules, all situated on a simple cubic lattice and undergoing rotational Brownian motion in the pure diffusion limit. An extensive set of simulations are reported in which four model properties, the solute dipole moment and charge, and the solvent polarity and relaxation time, have been systematically varied. Static and dynamic aspects of dipole solvation observed in these systems are compared to the predictions of the simple continuum and dynamical mean spherical approximation (MSA) theories. Within the linear solvation regime the MSA theory is found to yield essentially quantitative predictions for both static and dynamic solvation properties. The simple continuum model, on the other hand, provides a poor description of either the static or the dynamic behavior. Solute rotational correlation functions of various rank and the dielectric friction functions calculated from them are compared to a variety of theories of rotational dielectric friction. Since all of the analytical theories examined rely on simple continuum descriptions of dipole solvation, they all fail to yield quantitatively accurate results. However, the more sophisticated theories do generally provide useful guides for understanding the trends observed in the data. The one instance where all of the theories fail in a qualitative manner is in predicting the rotational dynamics in the slow solvent limit. Reasons for this failure are discussed and a semiempirical approach for understanding the actual behavior in this limit is presented.},

At the heart of this family of in silico techniques lies the crucial idea of computing the many-body interactions by solving the electronic structure problem "on the fly" as the simulation proceeds, which circumvents the need for pre-parameterized potential models. In particular, the field of proton transfer in hydrogen-bonded networks greatly benefits from these technical advances. Here, several systems of seemingly quite different nature and of increasing complexity, such as Grotthuss diffusion in water, excited-state proton-transfer in solution, phase transitions in ice, and protonated water networks in the membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin, are discussed in the realms of a unifying viewpoint.},

For the extension of this theory to concentrated solutions, more accurate computations of the Coulomb forces are needed; in addi- tion, it becomes necessary to make more specific assumptions about the non-Coulomb forces, which are important for small dis- tances between the ions. This theory of concentrated electrolytes has met with many difficulties; in part, conflicting results have been deduced.},

@article{Hofinger2001,
abstract = {A boundary element formulation of continuum electrostatics is used to examine time-independent dielectric relaxation and screening in two proteins, and time-dependent relaxation in two simpler solutes. Cytochrome c oxidation is modeled by inserting partial charges on the heme, using one to three dielectric regions in the protein. It was suggested recently that for charge insertion on a protein-bound ligand, all or part of the ligand should be treated as a cavity within the protein medium. Here, the effect of an internal cavity surrounding the central heme atoms is examined, considering separately the static and relaxation (or reorganization) free energies. The former is the free energy to remove the redox electron while maintaining the rest of the structure and charge distribution fixed; the latter is the free energy associated with the relaxation into the product state after the corresponding constraints are released. The effect of the cavity is found to be small for the static free energy, while for the relaxation free energy it is large, as polarization of groups immediately around the heme dominates the relaxation. If the protein surface groups are treated as a distinct medium with a dielectric of 25 las suggested by recent molecular dynamics simulations), the relaxation free energy decreases significantly (from -37.0 to -43.9 kcal/mol), compared to a model where the whole protein has a dielectric constant of two. Therefore, with this model, although polarization of groups immediately around the heme still dominates the relaxation, polar groups near the protein surface also contribute significantly, and solvent negligibly. The screening of an applied field within myoglobin is calculated, with the protein surrounded by either a low-dielectric or a high-dielectric glass. In the vicinity of the CO ligand, the screening is approximately isotropic with a low-dielectric glass. It is anisotropic with a high-dielectric glass, but the applied and local fields are still approximately parallel. This has implications for experiments that probe dielectric screening in proteins with the newly developed technique of vibrational Stark spectroscopy: with a high-dielectric glass, a single, rotationally averaged screening factor can be used, the local field being about 1.65 times the applied field. Finally, we calculate the time-dependent relaxation in response to instantaneous charge insertion within a spherical cavity in a Debye solvent, and to photoexcitation of a tryptophan solute, illustrating the extension of the boundary element formulation to time-dependent problems.

The model is able to indicate the conditions which a mixture composed of two liquids with very different relaxation times must fulfill to produce a single relaxation time, as often experimentally observed. Some significant results reported in the literature are analyzed and explained and new experimental data are reported in order to test specific features of the model.

The theoretical calculation in our previous work [T. Yamaguchi, T. Matsuoka, and S. Koda, J. Chem. Phys. 135, 164511 (2011)] is reanalyzed, and it is shown that the dielectric relaxation spectra are composed of three components, namely, the relaxation of ionic atmosphere, the reorientational relaxation of ion pairs, and the collision between ions. The relaxation frequency of the slowest one increases with increasing the concentration, and the slower two relaxations, those of ionic atmosphere and ion pairs, merge into one at the concentration where the Debye length is comparable to the size of ions. Experimentally, the dielectric relaxation spectra of some electrolytes in two solvents, tetrahydrofuran and tetraglyme, are determined at frequencies from 300 kHz to 200 MHz, and the presence of the slower two relaxations was confirmed. The concentration dependence of the relaxation frequency is also in harmony with the theoretical calculation. The relationship between the dielectric relaxation spectra and the concentration dependence of the ionic conductivity is discussed.},

abstract = {We discuss the quantum fluctuations of the fields associated with a broad class of optical scattering and transmission problems by developing the quantum electrodynamics of an idealized linear, but nonuniform, dielectric medium. We present and compare two quantization schemes for this purpose. The first is based on the expansion of the field in terms of a set of single-frequency solutions of the Maxwell equations. The second involves expanding the field in the set of plane-wave solutions of the Maxwell equations in the vacuum. The relation between the two quantization schemes is discussed in the framework of the scattering theory that connects them. The methods presented are used to show that various field components within a dielectric medium may be either superfluctuant or subfluctuant relative to their fundamental uncertainties in the vacuum. These alterations of the fluctuation properties of the fields are shown to lead to changes in the spontaneous emission rates for both electric and magnetic dipole transitions of excited atoms within or near dielectric media. We also analyze the quantum properties of the transition radiation emitted by a fast charged particle in passing from one dielectric medium to another.},

Significant improvements in experimental time resolution (similar to 100 fs instrument response) as well as corresponding improvements in analysis methods provide confidence that all of the spectral evolution (including both the inertial and the diffusive parts of the response) are observed in these measurements. Extensive data concerning the steady-state solvatochromism of C153, coupled to an examination of the effects of vibrational relaxation, further demonstrate that the spectral dynamics being observed accurately monitor the dynamics of nonspecific solvation. Comparisons to theoretical predictions show that models based on the dielectric response of the pure solvent provide a semiquantitative understanding of the dynamics observed},

An improved calibration procedure of the dielectric measurement system for conducting samples was developed. The complex permittivity spectra have been represented by a Cole−Cole relaxation time distribution. Where possible, the obtained fitting parameters, static permittivity $\epsilon$ and relaxation time $\tau$, and distribution parameter $\alpha$, are compared with literature data to assess the performance of the instrument, which was found to be comparable to that of time domain and waveguide systems. Effective solvation numbers were deduced from the effect of NaCl concentration on $\epsilon$. The data suggest that in addition to the irrotational bonding of water molecules by Na+ ions, kinetic depolarization under slip boundary conditions determines the solution permittivity. A three-state model is proposed to describe the concentration dependence of $\tau$.},

abstract = {Measurements with different techniques point to a strong affinity of hydroxide ions for interfaces between water and hydrophobes, but some spectroscopic experiments do not detect excess hydroxide at the interface, while others do. Hydroxide ions are unusual in that they reduce the relative permittivity of an electrolyte solution more than other monovalent, monatomic ions. This implies that they suppress the collective dipole-moment fluctuations of nearby waters. We show that the absence of these fluctuations leads to a Hamaker-like force on the hydroxide ion that attracts it to regions where dipole-moment fluctuations are smaller than in bulk water, in other words, to regions of low relative permittivity. We show also that there is no contradiction between the picture of the basic, negatively charged interface and spectroscopic measurements. This is, in part, because the hydroxides are mostly below the outermost molecular layers. By combining a simple model for this fluctuation force with a modified Poisson-Boltzmann equation, we reproduce the dependence of the zeta-potential on pH, including the low isoelectric point, the approximate magnitude of the experimental surface charge density, and the Jones-Ray data for the dependence of surface tension on electrolyte concentration. We discuss also the apparent contradiction between molecular-dynamics simulations that deny and experiments that support a basic, negatively charged interface.},

@article{Ladanyi1999,
abstract = {The phrase $\backslash$glqq dielectric friction$\backslash$grqq$\backslash$ tends to bring to mind the drag force exerted by a polar liquid on some translating ion or rotating dipolar molecule, but the underlying idea is far more general. Any relaxation process taking place in a polar environment, including those involving solvation and vibrational relaxation, has the potential to be strongly affected by the special dynamics associated with Coulombic forces. Indeed, there is considerable evidence that vibrational energy relaxation is noticeably accelerated in hydrogen-bonding solvents. What is less clear is precisely how electrostatic forces achieve the accelerations they do and to what extent this phenomenon relies on specifically protic solvents. We explore this issue in this paper by using classical molecular dynamics to study the vibrational population relaxation of diatomic solutes with varying levels of polarity dissolved in both dipolar and nondipolar aprotic solvents. We find that the conventional analysis based on partitioning the force autocorrelation function can be usefully extended by adapting an instantaneous perspective; distinguishing between the purely equilibrium effects of the instantaneous liquid structure surrounding a solute and the solely nonequilibrium effects of the relaxation dynamics launched from those initial conditions. Once one removes the powerful influence of electrostatic forces on the liquid structure, either by simple normalization or by looking at the $\backslash$glqq force-velocity$\backslash$grqq$\backslash$ autocorrelation function, the subsequent dynamics and therefore the mechanism of the relaxation is revealed to be dominated by short-ranged repulsive forces, even under the most polar circumstances. The main rate-enhancing effect of Coulombic forces seems to be an equilibrium electrostriction: The solvent is simply ordered around the solute in such a way as to amplify the repulsive forces. At least in our examples, the slowly varying character of Colombic forces actually makes them quite ineffective at any kind of direct promotion of vibrational energy relaxation.},

abstract = {Almost 100 years ago, two different expressions were proposed for the energy-momentum tensor of an electromagnetic wave in a dielectric. Minkowski's tensor predicted an increase in the linear momentum of the wave on entering a dielectric medium, whereas Abraham's tensor predicted its decrease. Theoretical arguments were advanced in favor of both sides, and experiments proved incapable of distinguishing between the two. Yet more forms were proposed, each with their advocates who considered the form that they were proposing to be the one true tensor. This paper reviews the debate and its eventual conclusion: that no electromagnetic wave energy-momentum tensor is complete on its own. When the appropriate accompanying energy-momentum tensor for the material medium is also considered, experimental predictions of all various proposed tensors will always be the same, and the preferred form is therefore effectively a matter of personal choice.},

abstract = {The scientific interest in room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) became extraordinarily high over the last two decades. While in the earlier days most of the studies focused on the synthesis and chemical properties, recently the interest in there physical, dynamical and structural properties is increasing. This thesis is aiming at the dynamical properties using dielectric relaxation spectroscopy. The first part of the thesis presents the development of new experimental routes and mathematical routines to record the dielectric spectra of liquids at microwave to far-infrared frequencies. It is followed by the discussion of the dielectric spectra of the neat, mainly imidazolium-based RTILs. Beside the extraction of the static dielectric constants, detailed information on the dynamics is obtained, including activation parameters. At room-temperature, the spectra are extended to terahertz and far-infrared frequencies, to cover the whole frequencies range relevant for intermolecular dynamics. Additional insight is gained by comparing these broadband spectra to molecular-dynamics simulations as well as to optical Kerr effect spectra. Finally, binary mixtures of RTILs with polar solvents are investigated. The studies on mixtures with dichloromethane are indicating an expanded RTIL-like range, where the dielectric characteristics remain similar to the neat RTIL. Only at high dilutions, the mixtures behave rather like a conventional electrolyte solution with pronounced formation of contact ion-pairs. On the other hand the mixtures with water indicate a more complex, heterogeneous structure.},

The degree of anomalous protonconductance decreases with increasing n in C n H2n+1OH, and conductance minima occur in aqueous alcoholic HCl solutions of low H2O content. Former theories of protonconductance have permitted no quantitative distinction to be made between the rates of classical proton transfer, quantum‐mechanical tunneling transfer, and water rotation as rate determining stages. If resonance in H3O{\textperiodcentered} is set up sufficiently quickly after arrival of a given proton at a water molecule, rotation of H3O{\textperiodcentered} cannot be a rate determining step. Detailed calculations of the rates of classical proton transfer, tunnel transfer, and the rate of rotation of water are made. Classical transfer is much slower and tunnel transfer much faster than corresponds to the observed protonmobility; rotation of hydrogen bonded water molecules near the H3O{\textperiodcentered} ion is the rate determining reaction (preceded and succeeded by fast tunneling of protons). This conclusion is quantitatively consistent with the OH′ mobility in water, and the H{\textperiodcentered}/D{\textperiodcentered}mobility ratio and qualitatively consistent with pressure and temperature effects and with the absence of abnormal mobility of NH4 {\textperiodcentered} and NH2′ in liquid NH3. A detailed interpretation of the dependence of abnormal conductance upon chain length in ROH gives fair quantitative agreement with experiment. The conductance minima observed in aqueous alcoholic HCl are quasi‐quantitatively predicted by the theory. The proton spends about 1{\%} of its time undergoing tunnel transfers; the effective existence of the H3O{\textperiodcentered} ion is thus confirmed.},

abstract = {This work develops an empirical model to evaluate the dielectric constant of single or multi-solvents containing multiple ions, using only one adjustable parameter per ion. Correlations are performed for 35 salts in water, 9 in methanol, and 3 in ethanol. The dielectric constant of 9 two-solvent solutions (containing water, methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, or acetone) is predicted. In addition, predictions of the dielectric constant of a mixture containing water, methanol, and NaCl are presented. Besides the specific parameter for each ion, a general parameter for cations and another for anions, specific to the each solvent, are obtained. They are recommended for calculating the dielectric constant in solutions whose experimental data are unavailable in the literature. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A theory for electron-transfer rates in a polar medium is developed using an expansion of the density matrix in Liouville space and utilizing the analogy with the problem of nonlinear optical line shapes. A separation of time scales between the populations and coherences (diagonal and off-diagonal elements of the density matrix, respectively) allows us to carry an approximate summation of the rate to infinite order in the nonadiabatic coupling. A closed expression for the rate and a novel criterion for adiabaticity, involving the entire frequency and wavevector-dependent dielectric function of the solvent c(k,w) are derived. A proper definition of the relevant solvent time scale in terms of c(k,w), which is not restricted to the Debye model, is obtained. The role of the solvent longitudinal dielectric relaxation in inducing the crossover from the nonadiabatic to the adiabatic regimes is analyzed.},
