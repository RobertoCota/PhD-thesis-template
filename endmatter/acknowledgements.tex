At this moment, while sitting by the sea with no company but a beer is when I find the calm to recall all the events that led to the end of my PhD. After the effort of evaluating all the experiences that I have passed through, I must confess that I was trapped between laughs and emotions. Although lasers can give you fantastic results (and make you happy and angry at the same time), the incredible people around me were the ones who made this PhD a one of success, a one of joy, and a one full of laughs and uncountable moments that I will treasure forever. Therefore this is undoubtedly the most important section of my dissertation, and I would have happily shared this beer at the beach with any of those who were part of my PhD story...
